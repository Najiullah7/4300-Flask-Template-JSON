bulbasaur,"A Bulbasaur often rests in bright places so its bulb can absorb sunlight. It can be seen napping in bright sunlight. While it sleeps, the seed on its back catches the rays and uses the energy to grow. In the wild, Bulbasaur tend to be very rare, as they are shy creatures that prefer the company of their own kind. However, they are also generally very docile, tame, and loyal to people that they trust, and for that reason are one of the species of Pokémon available for starting trainers to choose in the region of Kanto.",Seed Pokémon,"grass,poison",2′04″,15.2,https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/1/,"A Bulbasaur often rests in bright places so its bulb can absorb sunlight.

ivysaur,"Ivysaur are able to naturally learn the powerful Grass-type attack Solar Beam, a move whose execution time depends largely upon the weather; it takes an excruciatingly long amount of time to perform this attack in hail, rain, or a sandstorm, but nearly no time at all in bright sunlight. Luckily, the latter is ​most common in the habitats of these Pokémon, as it is vital that the bulbs on their backs receive ample sunlight so that they can photosynthesize and develop.

venusaur,"Venusaur are powerful but relatively nonviolent Pokémon. Despite their menacing appearances, Venusaur are docile Pokémon, preferring to sunbathe so that the plants on their backs can photosynthesize rather than fight. They follow sunny patches that reach the forest floor as the sun moves across the sky. With enough solar energy, the flowers on their backs can release a fragrance that calms both hostile Pokémon and people alike. The scent also attracts a number of Bug-type Pokémon to the flowers as well to aid in their pollination during the breeding season. This ability allows Venusaur to serve as peacekeepers of sorts in their native forests, not only stopping fights that break out in their territories, but also defending their domains from dangers with their might if necessary. Female Venusaur have seeds in their flowers, which they plant into the backs of their offspring to grow into new plants. Their gentle dispositions but great power are what make them one of the most well-rounded Pokémon any Kantonian trainer could start their Pokémon journeys with.",Seed Pokémon,"grass,poison",6′07″,220.5,https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/3/,"Venusaur are powerful but relatively nonviolent Pokémon.

charmander,"Charmander is easily the most mild-mannered and well-behaved of its evolution line. Its feelings and emotions can be read by the flame on the tip of its tail. It flares up in a fury when Charmander is angry. The flame will flicker and grow small and dim If Charmander is sick or hurt. If it growls that means its angry or is about to attack.Charmander however doesnt do well with impatient people. It doesnt appreciate being rushed, and most of the time, will not allow it.

charmeleon,"Charmeleon, like its other evolutionary forms, can naturally breathe fire. Its powers, though, are much greater than Charmanders, but not as great as Charizards.Charmeleon is also much more aggressive than Charmander. It is believed to have a vicious nature and will constantly seek out opponents. Strong opponents excite this Pokémon, causing it to spout bluish-white flames that torch its surroundings. It is a very ruthless, pitiless and zealous fighter often using its claws. However, it will relax once it has won.In their fervor, their tails often begin to burn a bluish-white; at night, they can light up mountainsides like stars if groups of them are present.

raticate,"Raticate remain just as much a nuisance to homeowners, only more aggressive. Luckily, however, they also live in smaller groups, as large groups Rattata generally split into groups of 8 to 10 or so upon evolution.

Alternatively, Persian and Purugly can also deal with Raticate.An Alolan Raticate will exert control over a group of Alolan Rattata that it will send out to search for food.

sandslash,"Sandslash is a resilient creature that lives in desert areas, particularly areas close to dry forests. It is commonly seen either climbing up trees or digging into the dusty ground, both activities which it is suited for thanks to its claws. However, though its claws are strong, they are not indestructible; they occasionally snap when Sandslash digs at an incredibly fast pace.

drowzee,"Drowzee consume dreams—especially those of young children and Pokémon, as they are said to be tastier than those of adults. For this reason, they can sometimes be found lurking outside daycares or kindergartens during naptime.There are many “signs” people believe Drowzee leave after eating dreams. For example, an itchy nose upon waking may mean one has sucked up a dream through your nostrils, or having a good dream but not remembering it means that it has been consumed. Drowzee (save for trained ones) rarely live near people, however, preferring to feed on the dreams of Pokémon in the grasslands that they call home.

For example, an itchy nose upon waking may mean one has sucked up a dream through your nostrils, or having a good dream but not remembering it means that it has been consumed.

When angered, they release this energy into currents that arc in the surrounding air, said to be equal in strength to 20 lightning bolts. After a Hisuian Electrode lets loose, the surrounding land is often totally scorched with the air still crackling, a telltale sign of its presence. If their holes are plugged, they become unable to release this energy until it builds up enough to pop the plug free.

marowak,"Marowak no longer grieve about abandonment; instead, their traumatic pasts become fuel for ruthless combat. They use bones to defeat foes with moves like Bone Club and Bonemerang. Marowak possess homing instincts that lead them back to their mothers’ tribes. They will join these tribes, never learning who their mothers truly were. Their loneliness has hardened them towards all deep social connections. Marowak will often fight one another in these tribes to the death for especially prized bones. The losers remains will supply tools for future Cubone. The abandonment of young is a coming-of-age for Marowak. Lone Cubone, though traumatized, return home as cold, ruthless fighters who have no qualms whatsoever about brutally beating or killing others. Marowak hardly even communicate with each other, and even more rarely do so with speech. They tap their bones on boulders in specific rhythms to send messages. There are known to be over 50 of these unique rhythms. These Pokémon despise Mandibuzz, who try to steal their prized bones, and will throw their bones at them to knock them out of the sky. In popular folklore where Cubone are believed to be wearing the skulls of their mothers, Marowak are spurred on to defend their bones by their desire to avenge their deceased parent.Such extreme pressure also favored individuals that worked together (in contrast to the distant relations of mainland Marowak). These Pokémon maintain the tradition of passing down the bones of loved ones; rather than dueling over them, however, Alolan Marowak seem to choose heirs that will have the honor of wielding their bones when they pass. These Pokémon remain close with one another for their whole lives. They hold elaborate mourning rituals involving their flaming bones for their fallen allies; though their bones may be repurposed, Alolan Marowak will create dirt mound graves along the sides of roads, fiercely attacking those who disturb them.

slugma,"Thin, transparent skin actually covers the bodies of Slugma. Instead of blood, however, their circulatory systems pump molten-hot lava to transport vital nutrients and minerals throughout their bodies. This lava bubbles out of small pores in their skin, leaving trails of the substance as they move around. Because of this unique system, Slugma can only live for extended periods of time in very warm areas, particularly volcanoes. Should they stop moving in cooler places, the lava within their bodies will begin to harden, become brittle, and crumble. The cooler Slugma are, the slower they will move, until they stop moving altogether. In areas where lava and magma are common, large groups of Slugma, sometimes numbering in the hundreds, can be seen congregating where the lava oozes out.

smeargle,"Smeargle live alone, but do maintain groups of “comrades”; comrade Smeargle will pass through each others territories, share details of food source locations with each other, and even paint each others bodies for fun. Their tails secrete a colorful, viscous fluid that they uses to paint trees, marking their domains in this manner. Different Smeargle have “paint” of different colors; the hue is determined by a variety of factors, including genetics, diet, and environment. Recent studies have shown that the intensity of their paint color changes based on their emotions. Smeargle born around the same time in the same area will become comrades with one another. These groups remain close for life, though they will separate and claim their own territories upon reaching adulthood.

tyrogue,"Tyrogue are a wandering Pokémon, having no fixed shelter and constantly moving to different locations.

If defeated, they will nurse their wounds until healed, but will then immediately search for the foe that defeated them and attempt to hold a rematch.

Their lips are particularly delicate; they use them as their main method of gathering information about their surroundings. When they come across something foreign, their first instinct is to run up to it (though they are rather clumsy and often fall) and kiss it. This is also how it cleans objects prior to touching them, smooching them and then licking the dirt off of its lips. Smoochum can distinguish and remember thousands of different objects based on their textures and taste from their lips alone. They then categorize these things into what they like and dislike.

dustox,"Dustox are nocturnal Pokémon, feeding on the leaves of trees after the sun sets. They use their antennae like radars to navigate without light, though their eyes are in fact quite adept at seeing in the dark. When Dustox flap their wings, they let loose clouds of fine, toxic powder strong enough to make pro wrestlers sick. They uses this in their defense, flapping and letting loose the dust to deter enemies. Dustox are attracted to bright lights, a problem for many urban areas; they will often congregate along boulevards and avenues, attracted there by street lamps and large trees. In their wake, Dustox swarms leave behind lines of barren branches and large clouds of toxic powder. Though they will consume nearly any variety of leaves (even some toxic ones, which may have to do with their Poison-typings), Dustox have shown a particular affinity for the leaves of Persim trees, even sometimes feeding on the Berries themselves.

Should two flocks encounter each other, they will begin to bicker and engage in fierce aerial fights over disputed territory. The battles only end once all members of one of the flocks have been knocked out of the sky. Staravia feed mostly on insects. While Starly tend to go after slow, grounded prey like Wurmple, though, Staravia can seize aerial insects in mid-flight.

kricketot,"Kricketot are famous for the xylophone-like sound their hard antennae make when they clang together. By shaking their heads back and forth, they can make their antennae ring musically; this is how Kricketot communicate with others of their kind. Though their antennae are mostly stiff, Kricketot can adjust them slightly near the tips. By subtly curling and uncurling their antennae, Kricketot can alter the lengths of their exposed sections, thereby changing the pitches they make when they clang together. Altering the pitch and the rhythm of their clattering enables Kricketot to send complex messages to their peers. During the mating season, male Kricketot will compete with each other to compose beautiful melodies in order to seduce mates. As their mating season coincides with the beginning of autumn, many people associate Kricketot songs with the arrival of fall.

By allowing their cries to resonate within their bellies, they can produce a unique sound that is difficult to mimic with conventional instruments. Some villages hold Kricketune concerts in the autumn, where their wildly variable melodies are rated against one another. In battle, their musical capabilities manifest as the attack Bug Buzz.

bastiodon,"Bastiodon, though slow, are very defensively strong. They are virtually invulnerable to frontal attacks, as their steel-hard faces can withstand immense damage. Though their rears and sides are not nearly as strong, they still are relatively tough compared to other species. Bastiodon live in herds of 30 or so members. They raise their young until adulthood. When their herds are threatened, Bastiodon will line up side by side and barricade their offspring; these impregnable walls easily defend Shieldon from most predators. This defense, however, is notably weak to aerial attacks. Because their fossils are often found together, it is believed Bastiodon frequently clashed with Rampardos. Their facial bones are so hard and oddly shaped that scientists once thought they were sort of horn or spike until the first Bastiodon was successfully resurrected. Despite their imposing size, Bastiodon are docile creatures. They spend most of their time traveling with their herds in search of Berries and grasses.

Their movements also become sharper and more agile as their flames intensify. Pignite are also skilled fighters, particularly when it comes to wrestling. They are close-range brawlers; though capable of shooting flames from a distance, they prefer to attack foes using their limbs or even their whole bodies. When Pignite begin to feel hungry, their internal fires will weaken from lack of fuel. Consequently, they will become sluggish and their attacks will weaken.

audino,"By touching the feelers on their ears to objects, these Pokémon can pick up even the smallest sound waves; because of this, Audino are common sights in hospitals and Pokémon Centers, where they are trained to use their feelers as stethoscopes to detect irregularities in the heartbeats of patients. Their hearing is so advanced that they can also use their feelers to assess other aspects of an individuals health, including blood pressure, breathing, and digestion. Some Pokémon breeders and daycare centers also employ Audino to assess Pokémon eggs and determine when they will most likely hatch. Even without using their feelers, their hearing is still superb, being as sensitive as many artificial radars. Audino are rarely seen in the wild, as they are shy Pokémon that retreat and hide when they hear someone approaching—considering their extraordinary aural abilities, this means that they almost always are hiding from potential enemies.

timburr,"Timburr are common sights in towns and cities, often seen working on construction sites alongside human builders. In the wild, Timburr are usually found in forests and wooded mountains.

Timburr are constantly looking for ways to improve the strength and stability of their homes. Every morning, they tear down the homes they built the day before to salvage materials for constructing new shelters, experimenting with different techniques and designs. This often leads to the creation of very strange-looking shelters, some of which are stable and some of which are not. It is said that these Pokémon enjoy building so much that they throw tantrums when unexpected rain halts their projects for the day.

tympole,"Tympole live in large groups known as “circles.” The growths on either side of their heads can vibrate quickly in order to produce ultrasonic waves. These waves, though imperceptible to humans, are how Tympole communicate with one another. When threatened, a Tympole will emit a distinctive pattern and frequency of sound that only other Tympole can hear; once the rest of the circle hears the warning, they will all begin to produce the same sound. The circle will then, as a group, adjust the frequency of the sound waves they are emitting until they become audible at an earsplitting pitch to attackers. In battle, this tactic manifests as the move Round. Curiously if a single Tympole is isolated and put under stress, it will emit an initial warning sound as usual, but will not attempt to stun the opponent with a subsequent deafening pitch, instead only holding the first note. This seems to indicate that Tympole will not attack until their warning calls are “confirmed” by allies, which occurs when other Tympole replicate the starting pitch.

They can be heard executing complex rhythms as a part of their mating rituals by vibrating their circular growths in various patterns. At the end of these songs, the individuals that created the most beautiful rhythms are the most likely to be chosen as mates.

terapagos,"Terapagos is a reptilian Pokémon that resembles a light-blue turtle. Terapagos has two light blue eyes with rouge rimming, while the rest of its head is a deeper shade of indigo. Its head is also decorated with small diamond protrusions, with two on top of its head and two more on either side. It has two small hands with three fingers each that barely poke out of its fur. Its fur is voluminous, its color varying with a gradient between a greenish yellow and sky blue. A second patch of fur also appears behind its shell, vaguely forming three separate tails.Terapagoss shell is made out of crystal, with 18 irregular pentagons on top decorated with differently colored symbols that resemble all 18 type icons, which regularly morph back and forth to abstract shapes. On the center of its shell is a small hexagonal protrusion, with a white hexagon on top of it with triangular extensions on each corner that connects it to the edges of the protrusion, slightly resembling the icon for the Terastal Phenomenon. The sides of its shell also have three obtuse pentagons each on the rim of the shell; however, these are a solid light blue color.Terapagos transforms into Terastal form when it is either in danger or about to battle. It can use the Terastal energy created within its body to produce crystals on its exterior, with these crystals, Terapagos clads itself in a larger, sturdier shell, thus entering its Terastal Form. In the anime, Terapagoss transformation in its Terastal Form is shown in more detail; Terapagos absorbs and crystallizes the energy around itself, causing its shell to grow and reshape itself, covering most of its body, leaving only its front feet, head and tail out, then the ring rubs on its neck and legs turn into fur that grow around its head into a mane and then around its tail into three, new, furry tails. The shell allows Terapagos to absorb energy and store it within itself. When using beam-like attacks, Terapagos pulls its hands and head into its shell, transforms its mane into a shape that resembles its 3 tails, flies up in the air, and shoots the attack from the diamond in the center of its shell.

Terapagos has two light blue eyes with rouge rimming, while the rest of its head is a deeper shade of indigo. Its head is also decorated with small diamond protrusions, with two on top of its head and two more on either side. It has two small hands with three fingers each that barely poke out of its fur.

On the center of its shell is a small hexagonal protrusion, with a white hexagon on top of it with triangular extensions on each corner that connects it to the edges of the protrusion, slightly resembling the icon for the Terastal Phenomenon.

In the anime, Terapagoss transformation in its Terastal Form is shown in more detail; Terapagos absorbs and crystallizes the energy around itself, causing its shell to grow and reshape itself, covering most of its body, leaving only its front feet, head and tail out, then the ring rubs on its neck and legs turn into fur that grow around its head into a mane and then around its tail into three, new, furry tails. The shell allows Terapagos to absorb energy and store it within itself. When using beam-like attacks, Terapagos pulls its hands and head into its shell, transforms its mane into a shape that resembles its 3 tails, flies up in the air, and shoots the attack from the diamond in the center of its shell.

pecharunt,"Pecharunt is a small Pokémon resembling a piece of mochi. It has two forms it can take both inside and outside of battle. The first form resembles an upside-down peach, with a black circle at the center and a thin, vertical line splitting its body into two halves. Inside of this circle are two white semicircle eyes. It takes its second form upon opening up, revealing a smaller inner body resembling a peachs pit. It has a darker purple and pink body with two white eyes, below which is a white, ribbon-shaped mouth. On its head rests two purple flaps and a scorpion-like ponytail. It has two heart-shaped paws at the bottom of its body, along with three black dots on each side underneath them. The discarded shell floats on both sides of Pecharunt, forming spiky wing-like appendages. The inside of these shells have a bright pink glow, outlined in black. The bright pink extends slightly through the black outline in six thin lines. The chains have a magenta color to them and are divided in identical segments, ending in a slightly larger segment with two protrusions, making it resemble the shape of Pecharunts shell.According to the player, Pecharunt smells incredibly sweet. It is known to cry and act like a baby in order to gain sympathy from others. If mortally wounded, Pecharunt will retreat into its shell and remain asleep for years. In Kitakami, it is known as the Never-Rotting Peach.Pecharunt stores poison in its peach-shaped shell and uses it to create toxic chains and roll up poisonous Binding Mochi, which are stored in its shell until they are needed. It is able to use its Toxic Chains in combat, badly poisoning its enemies in the process. The chains are also capable of empowering other Pokémon, using its toxins to enhance certain aspects of their bodies, such as their muscles, brain, or looks, as seen with the Loyal Three. It serves its mochi to Pokémon and humans, but may also shoot them at their mouths if necessary. According to Penny, the mochi that Pecharunt creates are somewhat sweet. The mochi draw out their deepest desires and powers, but the ones who eat it become chained to its will as seen with its caretakers, who had their greed drawn out, but in some cases, the ones that eat it may completely fal under its control, as seen with Mossui Towns residents and the players Paldean friends. The only known way to eliminate Pecharunts influence is by catching either it or those tied to it; the latter is implied by Pecharunts reaction to any of the Loyal Three fighting against it, as they no longer appear to be chained to its will.Humans under Pecharunts control have purple eyes and are surrounded by a purple aura. The controlled humans also hold their arms while performing a chicken dance-like movement, repeating the word mochi constantly. However, in some cases like with Hideko, it is shown that the possessed human can still speak somewhat freely, though it may simply be Pecharunt influencing the propagation of the mochi among humans. Humans under its influence are often still prone to innate emotion and desires — Arven is visibly embarrassed while dancing, Penny instinctively combines the word mochi with Veevee, and Nemona still expresses a strong urge to battle, being able to morph mochi into match. It can even command humans or even Pokémon to fight for it in battles, managing to control multiple humans at once. It relies on others to fight for it due to its cowardly personality and size. However, Pecharunt will fight back if it is left with no other option. Capturing Pecharunt will free those under its control with no memories of being controlled. The effect of Pecharunts mochi on people are likened by Kieran to a curse.According to myth, Pecharunt came from a distant land where it was adopted by an elderly couple with no children. Pecharunt fed its adoptive parents Binding Mochi to secure their affection, which brought out their inner greed. They made many requests of Pecharunt, who gave them what they requested to be showered with further attention. The couple eventually asked for four shining masks, which could only be found in Kitakami. Pecharunt left to obtain the mask, recruiting Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti to aid in its quest. They successfully stole three masks from Ogerpon, who defeated the Loyal Three in retaliation; Pecharunt only survived by going dormant within its shell.
