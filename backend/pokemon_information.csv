bulbasaur,"A Bulbasaur often rests in bright places so its bulb can absorb sunlight. It can be seen napping in bright sunlight. While it sleeps, the seed on its back catches the rays and uses the energy to grow. In the wild, Bulbasaur tend to be very rare, as they are shy creatures that prefer the company of their own kind. However, they are also generally very docile, tame, and loyal to people that they trust, and for that reason are one of the species of Pokémon available for starting trainers to choose in the region of Kanto.
",Seed Pokémon,"grass,poison",2′04″,15.2
ivysaur,"Ivysaur are able to naturally learn the powerful Grass-type attack Solar Beam, a move whose execution time depends largely upon the weather; it takes an excruciatingly long amount of time to perform this attack in hail, rain, or a sandstorm, but nearly no time at all in bright sunlight. Luckily, the latter is ​most common in the habitats of these Pokémon, as it is vital that the bulbs on their backs receive ample sunlight so that they can photosynthesize and develop. As the bulbs grow larger and these Ivysaur become more powerful, they must spend increasing amounts of time in the sun in order to foster their growth. When Ivysaur are preparing to evolve into Venusaur, they will spend more time sunbathing and their bulbs will begin emanating a sweet, pleasant aroma.
",Seed Pokémon,"grass,poison",3′03″,28.7
venusaur,"Venusaur are powerful but relatively nonviolent Pokémon. Despite their menacing appearances, Venusaur are docile Pokémon, preferring to sunbathe so that the plants on their backs can photosynthesize rather than fight. They follow sunny patches that reach the forest floor as the sun moves across the sky. With enough solar energy, the flowers on their backs can release a fragrance that calms both hostile Pokémon and people alike. The scent also attracts a number of Bug-type Pokémon to the flowers as well to aid in their pollination during the breeding season. This ability allows Venusaur to serve as peacekeepers of sorts in their native forests, not only stopping fights that break out in their territories, but also defending their domains from dangers with their might if necessary. Female Venusaur have seeds in their flowers, which they plant into the backs of their offspring to grow into new plants. Their gentle dispositions but great power are what make them one of the most well-rounded Pokémon any Kantonian trainer could start their Pokémon journeys with.
",Seed Pokémon,"grass,poison",6′07″,220.5
charmander,"Charmander is easily the most mild-mannered and well-behaved of its evolution line. Its feelings and emotions can be read by the flame on the tip of its tail. It flares up in a fury when Charmander is angry. The flame will flicker and grow small and dim If Charmander is sick or hurt. If it growls that means it's angry or is about to attack.
Charmander however doesn't do well with impatient people. It doesn't appreciate being rushed, and most of the time, will not allow it. It is a sweet Pokémon, but is feisty nonetheless. Charmander doesn't enjoy accepting favors, because it feels it owes something in return. It is extremely loyal to its loved ones, and knows a good thing when it sees it. It will treat those in its life accordingly.
Charmander is rarely found in the wild since it's a First partner Pokémon. Sometimes they gather in extremely hot areas such as active volcanoes or in craggy mountains and in caves along the coast of the Sevii Islands.

",Lizard Pokémon,fire,2′00″,18.7
charmeleon,"Charmeleon, like its other evolutionary forms, can naturally breathe fire. Its powers, though, are much greater than Charmander's, but not as great as Charizard's.
Charmeleon is also much more aggressive than Charmander. It is believed to have a vicious nature and will constantly seek out opponents. Strong opponents excite this Pokémon, causing it to spout bluish-white flames that torch its surroundings. It is a very ruthless, pitiless and zealous fighter often using its claws. However, it will relax once it has won.
In their fervor, their tails often begin to burn a bluish-white; at night, they can light up mountainsides like stars if groups of them are present. Enraged Charmeleon often take out their anger on their surroundings, incinerating anything flammable around them with unrestrained Flamethrowers. 
This stage is often likened to a human’s teenage years--moody and reckless. For starting trainers, reining in disobedient Charmeleon can be extremely challenging, as well as potentially dangerous if not handled well. However, with proper care and treatment, a trainer can earn a Charmeleon’s respect, and eventually its obedience as well.
Charmeleon, along with Charmander and Charizard, can be found in hot, rocky mountainous areas.
",Flame Pokémon,fire,3′07″,41.9
charizard,"Charizard are noble and will not turn the full power of their flame on opponents significantly weaker than they are. Charizards are also known to be very eager to battle. Charizard seeks out stronger foes and only breathes fire during battles with worthy opponents. The fiery breath is so hot that it can turn any material to slag. They can be very dangerous and aggressive if provoked. But like Charmander and Charmeleon, it is friendly and affectionate with its Trainer. Charizard only ignores its Trainer if it feels it's Trainer does not care about it. Only a weak Charizard shows off its power, as said by Liza in Charizard's Burning Ambitions.
",Flame Pokémon,"fire,flying",5′07″,199.5
squirtle,"Squirtle is usually well behaved, yet it has an underlying rebellious streak. It likes to be open with only a limited number of people and won't advertise its secrets. It prefers to stay within a close knit group, but can still enjoy making new friends. Other Pokémon may regard it as difficult and hard to get along with, but only if they have previously gotten on its bad side.",Tiny Turtle Pokémon,water,1′08″,19.8
wartortle,"They use water to cloak themselves before attacking prey and swiftly swimming after them, using their ears and tails to balance themselves.
Wartortle pride themselves on scratched shells, as they show toughness in battle. Generally, it is believed that the more scratches a Wartortle gains during this stage, the stronger it will be after evolution.
",Turtle Pokémon,water,3′03″,49.6
blastoise,"Blastoise can take the role of a leader in large groups of Squirtle and Wartortle. Its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes. Blastoise are watchful Pokémon. They dislike humans in their territory, but will not attack unless provoked. They tend to fight when they sense danger.
",Shellfish Pokémon,water,5′03″,188.5
caterpie,"Caterpie are known for their great appetites, usually eating many leaves before creating cocoons to evolve. They use self-made silk to both produce cocoons for evolution.
As weak, soft-bodied Pokémon, Caterpie attempt to gather as much energy as possible to hasten their evolutions into Metapod, and afterwards into Butterfree. However, they are not completely defenseless and do have a few tricks up their sleeves. Firstly, the large eyes on their heads can trick and confuse predators into thinking they are dealing with much larger Pokémon. Secondly, the suction pads on their feet allow them to climb nearly any surface and escape from predators. Additionally, Caterpie can use String Shot to slow down their enemies and buy time for escape. Finally, the antennae on their heads release a very noxious odor when disturbed. These defense mechanisms allow Caterpie to thrive in their native habitats, and combined with the large clutch sizes of Butterfree, make them are one of the most common Pokémon trainers encounter in forests.
",Worm Pokémon,bug,1′00″,6.4
metapod,"When preparing to evolve, Caterpie spin cocoons around themselves. These cocoons, while still vulnerable when soft, will eventually harden into iron-hard casings, triggering their evolutions into Metapod.
To avoid attacks, these Pokémon stay motionless and simply ​wait. Metapod are remarkably patient, enduring whatever pain they must to reach their final stages. They must remain upright while biding their time or risk spilling out their innards.
They are often regarded as nearly useless in battle, as freshly-caught Metapod are incapable of damaging foes at all (other than by using Struggle). Luckily, however, the Caterpie line undergoes some of the quickest evolutions known to date, and it does not take very long for Metapod to finally evolve into Butterfree.
",Cocoon Pokémon,bug,2′04″,21.8
butterfree,"Butterfree consume honey from flowers and are excellent at detecting sources of it. They can trace minutes amounts of pollen back to flower patches, where they then feast on honey and nectar. Using the hairs on their legs, Butterfree are also able to carry the sticky substance back to their nests. They often fly as far as 6 miles (10 kilometers) to find nectar in blooming flowers.
Because of their water-resistant wings, Butterfree can often be found fluttering about in the misty upper levels of rainforests. However, the high moisture is not necessary for their survival; they are simply highly tolerant of it, so they are also found in drier forests as well, often flying in small swarms to search out locations where honey is abundant. They sometimes compete with Cutiefly for territory.
",Butterfly Pokémon,"bug,flying",3′07″,70.5
weedle,"The stingers and brightly colored bodies of these Pokémon are intended to ward off potential predators who would not enjoy a mouthful of toxins. Weedle also have a sharp sense of smell, using their nose-like proboscises to sense which leaves are safe to consume. Some Weedle even develop preferences for certain leaves. They are voracious eaters, consuming their weight in leaves daily.
",Hairy Bug Pokémon,"bug,poison",1′00″,7.1
kakuna,"Weedle seek out trees, branches or piles of leaves to hide in; when they evolve into Kakuna, their ability to move becomes severely restricted, and they can only inch about very slowly. They can sometimes be seen hanging from tree branches on strands of silk in large numbers. Kakuna can only learn Harden naturally. When provoked, though, they can also extend poison barbs from their tips slightly to defend themselves. These Pokémon try to conserve as much energy as possible for evolution, however, so they will only exert energy to unsheathe their barbs when absolutely necessary.
Their hard cocoons protect the soft bodies within, which essentially liquify as they reconfigure themselves for evolution. This process, a fervor of activity that contrasts their immobility, causes their internal body temperatures to rise drastically, so much so that the shells of Kakuna nearing evolution feel uncomfortably hot to the touch. Their bodies only continue to heat up as they draw closer to their final transformations.
",Cocoon Pokémon,"bug,poison",2′00″,22
beedrill,"Beedrill is extremely territorial and will attack anyone who gets too close to their hive.
They are aggressive Pokémon and collectively attack the people around them. As seen in ""Challenge of the Samurai"", they are also concerned with the welfare of their previous forms. Beedrill are also vital to the ecosystems of Kantonian and Johtonian forests, helping prevent populations of Pokémon such as Paras and Pidgey from growing uncontrollably. Trainers traveling in Beedrill territory are strongly advised to bring along Pokémon that can handle Beedrill and their attacks, such as Twineedle and Poison Jab, as well as to bring along a number Pecha Berries and Antidotes.
",Poison Bee Pokémon,"bug,poison",3′03″,65
pidgey,"Pidgey are very docile Pokémon that prefer to avoid confrontation with other Pokémon and humans altogether, hiding in tall grass to prevent themselves from being seen. If cornered, though, they will attempt to escape by using Sand Attack to blind foes or Whirlwind to blow them away and buy themselves time to fly away. When hunting, however, Pidgey often use these attacks to stir up their surroundings, exposing vulnerable insects for them to chase down. 
These Pokémon have extremely keen senses of direction. They can always find their way back to their nests regardless of how far they have flown. Because of this, Pidgey were commonly used to send messages in the Kanto and Johto regions (much like the Wingull of Hoenn), at least until the advent of e-mail. Many Pidgey have grown accustomed to and now dwell in urban areas due to this practice, flying to forests and fields only to hunt for food before returning to their nests in cities. Some people still train Pidgey to deliver messages as a way of preserving tradition.
",Tiny Bird Pokémon,"normal,flying",1′00″,4
pidgeotto,"Pidgeotto can be dangerous and should be approached with caution. This is due to its large size and aggressive territorial nature. It will attack anything with its sharp claws that wanders into its territory if it perceives the intruder as a threat, which it often does. Pidgeotto is known to be carnivorous as they are shown to prey on several Pokémon such as Exeggcute, Caterpie, and Magikarp. Most urban Pidgey nearing evolution migrate, often in flocks, to the nearby forests where they hunt; they then split up and stake out their own territories.
",Bird Pokémon,"normal,flying",3′07″,66.1
pidgeot,"Pidgeot is even more dangerous than its previous evolutionary stage. This is because it is bulkier and more aggressive than Pidgeotto, enabling it to catch much bigger prey. A favorite target is Magikarp, which Pidgeot can spot from a great distance. Trainers should be very careful when approaching this Pokémon in the wild.
While still territorial, they no longer attack others for simply entering their turfs; rather, they wait and use their keen eyesight to watch from far away, seeing whether their intruders have ill intentions. If they are not endangering the Pokémon or their offspring, they will leave them be. However, they will defeat potential threats without hesitation using their powerful chest muscles to whip up windstorms strong enough to bend tall trees.
When approached, Pidgeot will spread out their wings to intimidate foes. If the tactic fails, they will quickly resort to flapping their wings to create powerful gusts before attacking with their talons. The beautiful, glossy feathers on their heads are symbols of speed in popular culture.
",Bird Pokémon,"normal,flying",4′11″,87.1
rattata,"Rattata is rat-like, with large incisors, a slight hump on its back towards the rear, a slightly pudgy belly, and a whisker on both sides. Female Rattata have shorter whiskers than the males. The fur of a normal variant is purple, with a white or cream colored underside: the fur of an Alolan variant is black with dark cram underside. Rattata have red eyes, with no obvious pupils. The tail is long, and curled slightly at the tip. Rattata have three-toed paws, which are the same color as its underbelly. Rattata that live in the Alola region have black fur instead of the usual purple. Their undersides are now a darker beige color and their fur is much scruffier, leaving their whiskers as tufts that resemble a moustache. The inside of their ears is also a dark blue color.",Mouse Pokémon,normal,1′00″,7.7
raticate,"Raticate remain just as much a nuisance to homeowners, only more aggressive. Luckily, however, they also live in smaller groups, as large groups Rattata generally split into groups of 8 to 10 or so upon evolution.  If a Raticate feels threatened, it will stand on its hind legs and let out a shrill shriek, calling its groupmates to join and defend it. The best way to defend against Raticate in the home is to prevent Rattata from invading in the first place before they evolve. Alternatively, Persian and Purugly can also deal with Raticate.
An Alolan Raticate will exert control over a group of Alolan Rattata that it will send out to search for food. Since these Pokémon are primarily urban, they can find calorie-dense foods much more easily; additionally, since these bosses rarely leave their nests, they do not have to burn much energy on hunting or moving. Alolan Raticate can afford to be very picky about their food because they obtain so much of it, stockpiling the bulk of what their underlings bring in their nests. They have highly developed taste buds that help them discern the freshest items. Ironically, this makes them useful to restaurant chefs, who often employ them in places where their cousins would be seen as pests. Alolan Raticate are fiercely territorial against others of their kind, engaging in 'turf wars' where Alolan Rattata groups fight one another for control. Only when all of its underlings have fallen will an Alolan Raticate emerge to fight on its own. Their webbed feet. a trait they share with their mainland relatives, enable them to swim from island to island with surprising ease.
",Mouse Pokémon,normal,2′04″,40.8
spearow,"Spearow prey on insects, and sometimes Sunkern, in grassy areas by flushing them out with their stubby wings, and plucking at them with their beaks. Spearow are very territorial, constantly buzzing about and calling with a loud cry that can be heard from half a mile away. This cry serves to scare away predators and to keep in touch with other Spearow, though the latter is reserved as an alarm to its kind.
",Tiny Bird Pokémon,"normal,flying",1′00″,4.4
fearow,"Like Spearow, Fearow are very territorial; luckily for travelers, though, they prefer to keep to themselves, only attacking those who draw too near to their nests or young. They use their narrow beaks to dig through soil or reach below the water to catch prey if needed. Because they are known to attack Pokémon often viewed as “cute” and “popular”, such as Pichu, Fearow are often maligned in popular culture as wicked, heartless fighters. However, anyone who has ever raised a Fearow know that while wary and sometimes aggressive to strangers, they can also be very loyal and protective Pokémon; archaeologists have found carvings of them protecting people in Johto.
",Beak Pokémon,"normal,flying",3′11″,83.8
ekans,"Ekans often live in tall grassy areas where they slither with great stealth. Ekans is also known to prey on Pokémon such as Pidgey, Spearow, and their eggs. Though often associated as a land Pokémon, they are capable of swimming long distances. When threatened in the wild, it will rattle its tail, flick its tongue to get its surroundings, and might use the move Glare to scare the opponent and have a possible getaway.
",Snake Pokémon,poison,6′07″,15.2
arbok,"This Pokémon is extremely territorial. Arbok are known to be vengeful and are absolutely ruthless in pursuing anyone or thing that angers them. They are also known to hunt smaller Pokémon like Woopers  and are capable of slithering to higher places such as trees to do so.
",Cobra Pokémon,poison,11′06″,143.3
pikachu,"Pikachu are usually friendly creatures that love to be cuddled. They love having their tails rubbed, especially at the base; they also like being stroked. However, if threatened or angered, this Pokémon can be quite aggressive. If someone pulls or steps on its tail, it is most likely it will bite or shock anyone in the area, including the one who pulled its tail.
However, in the anime and in the wild of the Kanto region they live in big groups deep in forests and are wary of humans.
In Kanto according to Ash in PJ035, Pikachu also greet one another by shocking them and sometimes they'll gather up in big groups to search for Thunderstones so they can evolve.
The Pikachu that live in the Pikachu Valley in Alola in the anime, greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Also, they can start duels with one another by sending electrical signals and the winner is decided when the opponent's tail is bitten.
",Mouse Pokémon,electric,1′04″,13.2
raichu,"Raichu is more confident, faithful and powerful than Pikachu, which makes them rivals, but sometimes it is just as friendly and cute. However, if it stores too much electricity in its body, it can become extremely short-tempered and aggressive. Yet, some of them are timid and will run away from people.
Usually, Alolan Raichu are often more playful than their normal counterparts. They use their surfboard-like tails to ride waves and to float in mid-air. When their cheeks are rubbed, they emit both electricity and a sweet-smelling aroma. Locals of the Alola region often states that Raichu got this change from eating lots of fluffy pancakes, which are a common delicacy in the Alola region.
",Mouse Pokémon,electric,2′07″,66.1
sandshrew,"Most Sandshrew are timid and they usually run away by digging holes. Despite this nature, they can become braver and more courageous once they're trained by skilled trainers. When their skin becomes wrinkled due to moisture, they head to volcanic areas and dry themselves out through laying on a spot with lots of geothermal heat. They are implied to eat bug types.
",Mouse Pokémon,ground,2′00″,26.5
sandslash,"Sandslash is a resilient creature that lives in desert areas, particularly areas close to dry forests. It is commonly seen either climbing up trees or digging into the dusty ground, both activities which it is suited for thanks to its claws. However, though its claws are strong, they are not indestructible; they occasionally snap when Sandslash digs at an incredibly fast pace. The claws will have started to grow back by the next day, though. The most notable behavior that Sandslash performs to cope with its environment is its method of curling up its body to become in essence a ball covered with large spikes, much like the hedgehog, armadillo, or pangolin. Sandslash rolls up so that the spikes shade its inner body from the sun and therefore prevent heatstroke that can result from the scorching heat that accompanies daytime in the desert.
Sandslash is a fully-armed predator when dealing with other Pokémon in the desert areas that form its natural environment. When attacked, Sandslash rolls up into its spherical guise and its spikes arrange to form its defense, after which the Pokémon will either roll away to escape or roll towards the opponent to attack. When trying to flee in this manner, Sandslash exerts specific force on the ground to kick up small-but-blinding dust clouds in its wake, hoping to discourage other Pokémon from following it. When attacking in this manner, though, Sandslash proves itself adept at making the opponent flinch with the spikes of its rolling body just before uncoiling itself and hacking with its claws. It prefers attacking from higher elevations when targeting prey.
",Mouse Pokémon,ground,3′03″,65
nidoran-f,"These small Pokémon are extremely timid and docile.Nidoran♀ are easily spooked, and it is not at all difficult to accidentally be scratched by a fleeing individual. If cornered, however, Nidoran♀ will defend themselves with their horns.It is rare to find a lone Nidoran♀, as they are very social Pokémon that are almost never seen without elder Nidorina and Nidoqueen, or at the very least sibling Nidoran♂, accompanying them. In fact, the vast majority of documented cases of Nidoran♀ poisonings have been attributed to skittish and scared wild individuals attacking out of sheer terror after having been separated from their families. Females have more sensitive nostrils and whiskers than males; they are quicker to detect predators because of this and will stay downwind when they sense one.",Poison Pin Pokémon,poison,1′04″,15.4
nidorina,"Like Nidoran♀, Nidorina tend to avoid confrontation but are fiercely defensive of their young.Like the rest of their relatives, they lives in burrows in open plains with their large family groups. These Pokémon are very affectionate with those in their tightly bonded family groups, and can easily become nervous or even upset when separated from them. When threatened, they will band together and screech loudly to bewilder predators with ultrasonic waves. To feed their young, they first chew food before spitting it out for their children to eat.
",Poison Pin Pokémon,poison,2′07″,44.1
nidoqueen,"They lead Nidoran families alongside Nidoking. These Pokémon are famously motherly, willing to defend their young with their lives. These Pokémon will block the entrances to their burrows using their bodies, with their venomous spines facing outwards, in order to defend their young. Nidoqueen are also known to set off earth-shaking tremors to scare potential attackers from their burrows. Younger Nidoran♀ and Nidorina look up to Nidoqueen—it is not uncommon for wandering Nidorina to end up lost in the mountains while searching for Moon Stones to evolve like their mothers. Nidoqueen placate crying offspring by placing them between the spines on their backs; these spines never secrete venom while the young are nearby.
",Drill Pokémon,"poison,ground",4′03″,132.3
nidoran-m,"Like females, males are shy and try to avoid fights, only using their venom to defend themselves as necessary when confronted. However, they will risk their lives to defend females that they are enamored with. Nidoran♂ are herbivores and consume plants as their main source of food, and can even devour toxic ones without any ill effects; some scientists even believe that Nidoran♂ gather their poison from such plants.",Poison Pin Pokémon,poison,1′08″,19.8
nidorino,"Nidorino are extremely aggressive Pokémon that are quick to Anger like Mankey. One he detects an enemy, all his spikes will bristle up at once and will go all out to challenge the foe(which may explain its other abilities).These Pokémon generally spend the day scouting and searching for food, returning to their burrows only at night to rest. They bring back resources to share with the rest of their families. However, even the slightest noise will awaken sleeping Nidorino, thanks to their highly sensitive ears. They will not hesitate to locate the source of a foreign sound and attack it with their horns, especially if the threat appears to be endangering their young.
",Poison Pin Pokémon,poison,2′11″,43
nidoking,"Nidoking attacks his foes by sweeping his large and bulky tail, his horn also contains venom. In Nidoran families, Nidoking assume the roles of protectors and hunters, patrolling in search of food to bring back to their burrows for their mates and offspring. An enraged Nidoking is particularly dangerous, as it will go on a rampage that can only be stopped either by defeating the Pokémon—a difficult task that only a few Pokémon can accomplish—or by being calmed down by its partner Nidoqueen. Threatening their families is one of the most common triggers for such attacks. Luckily, their rarity in the wild in combination with their tendency to stay away from human settlements makes berserk Nidoking a very rare, albeit still very dangerous, problem in most metropolitan areas.
",Drill Pokémon,"poison,ground",4′07″,136.7
clefairy,"Clefairy is very timid and rarely appears in front of humans. But it is very clever, and there are awareness among social and religious groups. Clefairy is a nocturnal Pokémon and will come out during the full moon to dance.
",Fairy Pokémon,fairy,2′00″,16.5
clefable,"Clefable is shyer than Clefairy. Due to its highly sensitive hearing, it will avoid noisy areas. On moonlit nights, they can rarely be seen walking towards secluded, deserted lakes; they are said to gaze at the moon in longing to return home, straining their ears to hear the voices of their brethren on its surface. It is said seeing a pair of them is a sign of a happy marriage.
",Fairy Pokémon,fairy,4′03″,88.2
vulpix,"Vulpix are very intelligent. When they face a stronger enemy, they'll distract the enemy by feigning injury&#160;and then escape. Vulpix is capable of manipulating fire to such precision as to create floating wisps of flame. These wisps are sometimes mistaken for ghosts by humans, but Vulpix uses them to assist in catching prey. When the temperature outside increases, it will expel flames from its mouth to prevent its body from overheating.
",Fox Pokémon,fire,2′00″,21.8
ninetales,"Ninetales have high intelligence and strong obsession. They can live for a thousand years when they use the power of their tails. They never let go of their vendetta against ones they have a grudge on, including the person's descendants. 
",Fox Pokémon,fire,3′07″,43.9
jigglypuff,"Jigglypuff has very stretchy skin and will inflate itself if it gets angry. In the anime, it has been shown to draw on people's faces after they have fallen asleep. However, most Jigglypuff are not accustomed to Pokémon with abilities like Insomnia, which prevent drowsiness. They will sing endlessly to try to put such Pokémon to sleep, putting themselves in danger of asphyxiation. Luckily, this behavior is generally a one-time mistake, and a Jigglypuff will quickly learn its lesson. Recently, it was discovered that different populations of Jigglypuff utilize different methods of singing, ranging from lilting melodies to near-shouts.
",Balloon Pokémon,"normal,fairy",1′08″,12.1
wigglytuff,"Wigglytuff are very gentle creatures that detest fighting. Even when they clash with one another, they only compete by inhaling air to see whose size increases the most. It sheds its fine fur when the season changes. The fur is gathered and spun into a luxurious yarn. Sleeping next to a one is said to be an amazing experience, and a few quirky luxury hotels tote Wigglytuff “sleeping buddies” for extra charge—a practice that benefits both person and Pokémon, as Wigglytuff love the company of people.They grow steadily to enormous sizes to scare off foes; the largest purportedly could grow to 20 times its resting size, though this specimen was never proven to exist. Once inflated, Wigglytuff can float and bounce around lightly like balloons. They compete with one another to see who can become the largest. Their large eyes are always covered with a thin layer of tears that wash away any particles that fall onto their delicate surfaces. 
",Balloon Pokémon,"normal,fairy",3′03″,26.5
zubat,"Zubat has the ability Inner Focus and the hidden ability Infiltrator. Inner Focus prevents Zubat from flinching. Infiltrator prevents the effects of Reflect, Magic Coat, and Light Screen from working.",Bat Pokémon,"poison,flying",2′07″,16.5
golbat,"Like Zubat, Golbat are found in caves and dark areas worldwide. Unlike Zubat, however, Golbat are hematophagous, consuming the blood of Pokémon and humans alike. They use their sharp fangs to puncture the skins of victims. Their saliva contains a substance that poisons and immobilizes prey, allowing them to drink blood at their leisure. Golbat can drink up to 10 ounces of blood in one sitting, possibly fatal for smaller victims. After doing so, however, their flight often becomes clumsy and erratic due to their heavy weights after large meals; they may become so heavy that they fall to the ground (and become easy prey themselves). Luckily, this feasting keeps them satisfied for a while; they only search for food during moonless nights when darkness conceals them. Recently, it has been discovered that Golbat broods will share blood with one another during times of scarcity; however, selfish Golbat that do not share blood when asked will find that other brood members will refuse to share with them in the future. Their fangs are hollow and consequently fragile. Notably, Golbat avoid light, metal (perhaps due to their poison being ineffective against Steel-types), and oddly enough, Durin Berries. While no one is quite sure why, Golbat tend to steer clear of them despite experiencing no ill effects upon consuming them. Surprisingly, Golbat are quite adroit on their oddly-shaped feet, which are adapted to create silent footsteps as they sneak up behind sleeping prey.
",Bat Pokémon,"poison,flying",5′03″,121.3
oddish,"Oddish is a nocturnal Pokémon, using moonlight rather than the sun's rays for photosynthesis. During the day, Oddish avoids the sun's heat and brightness by burying itself into the earth, leaving only the leaves on top of its head visible above ground. This way, it disguises itself as a plant, misdirecting its carnivorous diurnal predators.
While buried, Oddish nourishes itself by absorbing nutrients from the soil using its feet, which are said to temporarily change into a root-like structure for this purpose.
If anyone pulls at Oddish's leaves and tries to uproot it while it is buried underground, Oddish will react by shrieking in a horrible voice.
Once nightfall comes, exposure to moonlight causes Oddish to become much more active. It extracts itself from the ground, and its extremities change back into the shape of legs. It then proceeds to bathe itself in the moonlight and grow, as well as wander around scattering its seeds. With the coming of dawn, the cycle repeats.
",Weed Pokémon,"grass,poison",1′08″,11.9
gloom,"The drool of Gloom is very powerful; it can be smelt from miles away. Around 1 in 1000 people like to smell its drool, however.",Weed Pokémon,"grass,poison",2′07″,19
vileplume,"The smell of the flowers attracts prey; when they draw close, Vileplume flap their petals, cloaking themselves and their targets in toxic pollen that quickly immobilizes victims. Even as they walk, Vileplume scatter pollen out of their blooms, turning the surrounding air a sickly yellow. This pollen can cause poisoning and paralysis in large amounts, but can also trigger massive allergy attacks in even trace amounts. Like Oddish and Gloom, Vileplume may hide partially buried in the soil, only exposing their flowers for unwary prey to investigate. Because of this, it is inadvisable to approach large flowers in swamps or jungles, as they may actually be Vileplume in disguise waiting for an opportunity to scatter pollen.
",Flower Pokémon,"grass,poison",3′11″,41
paras,"Paras are covered in fungal spores upon birth, specifically that of a variety known as tochukaso. As a Paras grows, so do the mushrooms on its back, which are not present at birth and do not emerge until later in development. Paras feed by burrowing and sucking nutrients out of tree roots; in turn, the mushrooms drain nutrients out of their host Paras's bodies. Paras must feed ravenously as a result. Recent discoveries have shown that the mushrooms also control part of their hosts’ brains, and in fact are the ones that signal for Paras to burrow for roots. Paras can be found in damp, dark areas where fungi thrive; sunlight and dryness can damage their bodies.

parasect,"It has been shown in Pokédex entries that Parasect gather in groups to feed off of the nutrients from trees (mostly the bark and roots). their fungi entirely overtake their bodies and minds. Parasect dwell in damp places due to their fungi's own preferences for moisture (they often compete with Shiinotic for land). They are highly aggressive.Throughout their lives, the mushrooms continues to drain their hosts until there is nothing left. At that point, they scatter spores over their hosts’ eggs to restart the cycle. If a Parasect's mushroom is entirely removed, the Pokémon enters a comatose state indefinitely.

venonat,Venonat can have the ability Compoundeyes or the ability Tinted Lens. Compoundeyes increases Venonat's accuracy by 30%. Tinted Lens increases the power of not-very-effective moves by 1.5x. Venonat's eyes are very accurate: they enable Venonat to easily catch extremely small prey. Conway has a Venonat in the episode Camping It Up.,Insect Pokémon,"bug,poison",3′03″,66.1
venomoth,Venomoth can have the ability Shield Dust or the ability Tinted Lens. Shield Dust negates all side effects of attacks. Tinted Lens increases non-effective moves by 1.5x. Venomoth's wings are covered with scales. The scales are poisonous and are released when Venomoth flaps its wings.,Poison Moth Pokémon,"bug,poison",4′11″,27.6
diglett,"Diglett live only a few feet underground, and feed on plant roots. They burrow through the ground at a shallow depth, leaving raised earth in their wake, perfect for planting crops. Diglett are frequently kept on farms for this reason. Diglett have very thin skin, and thus if a Diglett is exposed to light its blood will heat up, causing it to grow weak. This weakness to heat causes Diglett to prefer dark places, sticking their heads up only when the sun is not bright. Otherwise, they pop up in caves. Diglett make their homes in tunnels and caves under the earth, most of which are made by burrowing Onix.
Alolan Diglett always feel the need to dig through volcanic rocks, making them much stronger than their other regional counterparts. Their head whiskers change shape depending on their mood. 
",Mole Pokémon,ground,0′08″,1.8
dugtrio,"Like Diglett, Dugtrio loathe sunlight. As triplets emerging from the same body, they also share the same thought process as each other. Nonetheless, Dugtrio are more aggressive than Diglett, and they'll try all kinds of methods to attack its enemy or opponents who are digging holes underground from all directions. Druddigon is a known predator of it.
Regardless, Dugtrio are very friendly with humans; Kantonian Dugtrio help people with agriculture, while Alolan Dugtrio are worshipped as feminine deities of the land incarnate regardless of gender. It is rumored that any hair picked up from Alolan Dugtrio will give bad luck. Thus, Alolans who see Kantoian Dugtrio will often be shocked by their lack of ""hair"".
Dugtrio live underground in caves. However, in Pikachu's Rescue Adventure, they live in hollow trees as well.
",Mole Pokémon,ground,2′04″,73.4
meowth,"Meowth usually preys on other weaker Pokémon, showing that it is carnivorous. However, it sometimes takes in fruits, so it is more accurate to call it an omnivore.
",Scratch Cat Pokémon,normal,1′04″,9.3
persian,"This Pokémon, while very beautiful and elegant is not the best pet, especially for new trainers. The reason for this is that Persian are known to have unpredictable temperaments and are apt to turn vicious in the blink of an eye, one moment it might be contentedly purring and rubbing its head against its trainer's hand while it is being petted, the next it could unsheathe its claws and scratch the hand that was petting it. Its tail raising straight is a sign of it being ready to pounce and attack.
The Alolan form of this Pokémon is even more difficult to look after, since it was spoiled by the royal families in ancient Alola and thus has made them much more disobedient towards Trainers. Despite this, it could be a strong battler in battles but not without applying underhanded tactics such as blindsiding and sucker punching, and will hostilely torment its fallen foes, though it sometimes gets defeated by opponents' counterattacks because of underestimation.
",Classy Cat Pokémon,normal,3′03″,70.5
psyduck,"Psyduck always hold their heads due to the fact that they have a near-constant headache. This makes them seem like they are unintelligent, when in fact they are quite clever and wily.
",Duck Pokémon,water,2′07″,43.2
golduck,"Using their webbed limbs, they can easily outspeed even the fastest human swimmers, and as such can make quick work of agile fish; they may even use their psychic abilities to disorient and disable their prey before catching them. Surprisingly, Golduck rely heavily on their tails for swimming strength, stamina and maneuverability in addition to their limbs. Golduck can swim for two days straight without rest. They can often be seen gliding agilely through the water at dusk in slower rivers (though they have no trouble with currents). 
Most scientists believe that Golduck, with their duck-like appearances and crepuscular natures, are the inspiration behind the mythical kappa, a common myth in regions like Kanto and Johto; in these regions, they were thought to punish those who polluted their rivers by pulling them beneath the waters.
",Duck Pokémon,water,5′07″,168.9
mankey,"Mankey are known for their incredibly short tempers. Even the slightest provocation can send them into fits of rage. Their bodies shudder uncontrollably and their nostrils flare up right before they strike. Then, they launch relentless flurries of attacks at their foes before they even get a chance to retaliate or escape. Despite their temperaments, Mankey are very social Pokémon that live in groups in the treetops. If one Mankey is angered, the entire colony will attack. In their huge frenzies, they are unable to tell friend from foe and may even attack one another, becoming even angrier. They are very agile creatures, able to swing in the trees to chase foes. If they lose track of their colonies, they will be infuriated by their own loneliness and attack everything they see. They may pass out from their tantrums, but be so angry in their dreams that they reawaken, and then become further enraged by the interruption. Notably, they enjoy bananas, Chesto Berries, and chestnuts, but their inability to peel the latter greatly enrages them. In Alola, it is said that Mankey live a long time because they never hold in their anger. However, despite this they are actually quite playful creatures.
",Pig Monkey Pokémon,fighting,1′08″,61.7
primeape,"Primeape is easily angered; even the slightest glance of eye contact will make it furious. When Primeape is furious, its blood circulation is boosted. This makes its muscles stronger, but at the cost of some of its intelligence. However, it has sturdy vessels in its brain that help keep it healthy. It will chase anyone who upsets it and will not stop until it has caught its quarry. Even if it is awoken from sleep, it will groggily chase whatever woke it.
",Pig Monkey Pokémon,fighting,3′03″,70.5
growlithe,"Growlithe are naturally loyal, obedient and protective to their Trainers, and will fearlessly confront any formidable opponents. Nonetheless, if one is improperly trained, it often bites without warning or unprovoked. They can also be territorial, easily attacking ones that they deem as invaders to their turfs.
",Puppy Pokémon,fire,2′04″,41.9
arcanine,"Arcanine are proud and regal, with a heart full of loyalty and justice. One can simply conquer the hearts of humans and other Pokémon through a thunderous roar. They can occasionally be seen dashing across prairies; in fact, this behavior is so well known that even in times past, people have recorded images of Arcanine's majestic sprint on various scrolls.  
In the anime, Arcanine has been shown to hide food in its mane and bring the hidden stash to their young.    
Scorched plains, prairies and active volcanoes are usually their habitats.
Because of its regal appearance and loyal temperament, Arcanine was known by many legends to help war commanders conquer countries long ago.

poliwag,"Poliwag will have one of two abilities; either Damp where the foe is unable to use Self-Destruct or Explosion, or Water Absorb where Water attacks heal 1/4 of Poliwag's health. With its light blue tail, it can swim very fast. It learns attacks such Bubble and Bubble Beam, and that was presumably why it has a small mouth. The mouth actually acts like a Suction cup to cling onto rocks with fats flowing water, much like the Lileep line's roots.
",Tadpole Pokémon,water,2′00″,27.3
poliwhirl,"Poliwhirl are amphibious. Though they are not nearly as clumsy on land as Poliwag, they still prefer to remain in the water, where they have fewer predators. Both Poliwhirl and Poliwag are mesmerized and drawn to the cries of Politoed, and will cease whatever they are doing to locate and congregate around the source of such noises. They have been shown to even respond to audio recordings rather than actual Politoed. 
",Tadpole Pokémon,water,3′03″,44.1
poliwrath,"Poliwrath is an adept swimmer and can outspeed even the fastest of human swimmers. However, it prefers to inhabit dry land rather than spending most of its life in aquatic habitats. 
Its muscle development is incredibly strong that Poliwrath itself can swim the entire Pacific Ocean without resting. 
In the Alolan Region, Poliwrath are well known as expert breast stroke swimmers. Children often imitate how Poliwrath swims. 
Poliwrath's body is all solid muscle. It is able to swim through frigid waters and smash through ice floes with its powerful arms. A skilled swimmer and martial artist, Poliwrath uses its strong arms to dish out powerful attacks.

alakazam,"Alakazam are highly intelligent Pokémon they exude so much psychic energy from their brains that those nearby may develop headaches. Their spoons are thought to have been created purely of this energy, though this has not been proven. An Alakazam can recognize its own spoons from another's, leading some to believe each pair is completely unique. These Pokémon will gift one of their spoons as a sign of utmost affection, and according to folklore anything eaten with a gifted spoon will taste sublime. In battle, Alakazam use their intellects to their advantage. They quickly calculate variables like type advantages, chance of missing, and so on. These factors make Alakazam popular choices for Psychic-type Pokémon amongst trainers, using their great minds to strategize in battles.

Machoke have incredible stamina like their pre-evolutions, not tiring even when doing the most strenuous of activities. They are always focused in battle, trying to get the most out of their training sessions.When their services are not required, they will return to the mountains to continue lifting and training themselves to become even stronger. In contemporary sculpting, Machoke are also popular motifs and even models for sculpting classes.

It is said to ensnare its prey in its vines and devour it, and can also spit a highly corrosive fluid that can melt even iron. This Pokémon prefers hot and humid environments, since it can absorb more moisture from the ground by planting its root-like feet. In battle, Bellsprout can take advantage of its flexibility to bend and sway its way out of the range of its opponent's attacks, no matter how powerful they may be. It is quick capturing its prey with its vines.",Flower Pokémon,"grass,poison",2′04″,8.8
weepinbell,All Weepinbell have the ability Chlorophyll. Chlorophyll increases Weepinbell's Speed when the sun is out. This Pokémon captures unwary prey by dousing them with a toxic powder.

tentacool,"It drifts aimlessly wherever the ocean currents take it, sometimes ending up in shallow waters where it may be accidentally caught in fishing lines. Tentacool may also end up stuck on beaches when low tide comes; since its body is largely composed of water, it will shrivel up, risking death from dehydration if it stays out of the sea for too long. Tentacool has two main weapons. At the tips of its tentacles are toxic feelers, which it uses to stab anything it touches with stinging acid. Due to its excellent camouflage in the water, Tentacool can often remain undetected by swimmers right up to the moment it stings them. Tentacool's gelatinous, watery body can also absorb sunlight and refract it within, producing beam energy it shoots from its crystal-like eyes.

Tentacruel has only a few differences from its pre-evolved form. It now has 14 long tentacles. It also has a beak; the mouthparts are on the front and back of Tentacruel's head, resembling blue pincers. Also, as seen in the image above, Tentacruel has two huge eyes below its head.

Natural abilities
Tentacruel can have the ability Clear Body or the ability Liquid Ooze. Clear Body prevents the opponent from lowering any of Tentacruel's stats. Liquid Ooze damages any opponent that tries to drain Tentacruel's HP.

Its arms are so strong that it can use them to climb mountains. Rhyperior sometimes accidentally shoot Geodude from their cannon-like arms, mistaken them as normal rocks.
The entire body of an Alolan Geodude is electrical and magnetic. Anyone who steps on a Geodude will feel a slight snap followed by a nasty jolt of electricity. Alolan Geodudes often compete in headbutting battles; the one with the strongest magnetic force will attract more iron sand.

golem,"Golem shed their skins annually to grow larger; their shells almost immediately crumble away into the soil, enriching it. Farmers strive to collect shed Golem pelts as a result. Their bodies are whitish and tender for a short period of time, but new shells will quickly harden upon contact with the air. However, Golem eventually stop shedding with age, and particularly old individuals may even start growing moss on their carapaces after some time. Earthquakes will sometimes send groups of Golem rolling down, endangering alpine homes. To protect these structures, grooves are often dug in the sides of mountains to redirect the paths of spooked Golem (and careless Graveler as well). 
",Megaton Pokémon,"rock,ground",4′07″,661.4
ponyta,"Ponyta is very weak at birth, so weak that it can barely stand up. This Pokémon however becomes stronger by stumbling and falling to keep up with its parent. It is known to run fast and jump high. It allows humans to ride on its back occasionally. However, if angered, it may choose to burn its rider by igniting its back. Although its mane is made of flames, it will never burn a trainer it trusts.
Galarian Ponyta has the ability to absorb life energy and store it in its mane, which causes it to glow. It never trusts wicked people, who it turns away and vanishes from, whenever it senses one with evil thoughts. If it accompanies with a Trainer, it means it knows the Trainer is a goodhearted person. In ""PJ055"", despite that they also have a tendency to be very shy and don't make themselves known to people very much and when in distress or in need of help they send psychic visions to those they trust regardless of the distance.  
",Fire Horse Pokémon,fire,3′03″,66.1
rapidash,"Rapidash is rather competitive and tends to have a rash nature. The fastest Rapidash will be chosen as its herd's leader, which determines the direction the herd is heading and the speed its herd runs. 
Galarian Rapidash is intrepid and resolute, taking pride in its abilities on being able to dash across the forests with the psychic powers stored in the hair around its hooves.
",Fire Horse Pokémon,fire,5′07″,209.4
slowpoke,"Slowpoke is described as dopey and rarely moves. It doesn't notice when the tail is bitten, cut off and even grown back. It can take them over 5 seconds to react to pain. To catch food, Slowpoke dangle their tails lazily from the shore into the sea. They secrete a sweet substance that attracts fish. However, due to their daftness, they sometimes forget why they were even near the water in the first place. It can take them up to a day to process bites on their tails.
Galarian Slowpoke used to eat the seeds of a certain plant that grew in their habitat. These seeds were in fact Galarica seeds, used to this day as an essential spice for cooking in the Galar region. The Slowpoke in Galar built up particles of this spice in their bodies over several generations, eventually gaining the unique appearance and behavior they are known for today. 
Galarian Slowpoke spend their days wallowing on seashores and riverbanks without thinking about anything in particular. Occasionally, they might get a very sharp look in their eyes, but they will soon revert to their zoned-out expression. It is thought that this behavior is caused by the accumulated Galarica particles stimulating Galarian Slowpoke's brain, resulting in it thinking of something tremendous—only for the Galarian Slowpoke to immediately forget what it had just thought of.
It is said that Galarian Slowpoke love Galarica Cuffs and Galarica Wreaths.

It is very peaceful and avoids confrontation most of the time. Slowbro are no longer able to fish with their tails and must, to their disdain, swim to catch food. 
",Hermit Crab Pokémon,"water,psychic",5′03″,173.1
magnemite,"Magnemite emit electromagnetic energy from its horseshoe magnets in order to keep afloat. It consumes electricity by attaching itself to power lines. During power outages, people would often find large groups of Magnemites congregating inside of circuit breakers. If a Magnemite runs low on its electrical energy supply, it would be rendered incapable of flight (but can be recharged by batteries). It is normally pacifistic and would mostly only retaliate with non-damaging moves. Under the guidance of a Pokémon Trainer, they can become devoted fighters (though the bond needs to be strong enough first). Magnemite dislikes some sort of signal that Power Stations use to repel them, and are sensitive to geomagnetic storms accodring to PJ093 that can induce them to gather together akin to Wishiwashi's Schooling ability.
",Magnet Pokémon,"electric,steel",1′00″,13.2
magneton,"Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that holds it together. Similar to its pre-evolved form, Magnemite, Magneton is able use electromagnetism to levitate and move around. The electromagnetic energy that Magneton emits is so strong that any nearby electronic devices would be fatally damaged; in fact, the strength of Magneton's electromagnetic powers are three times more stronger than Magnemite's. Another dangerous side effect of Magneton's strong electromagnetic force is creating black outs in many cities; because of this, many cities forbid any Trainer from letting Magneton out of its Poké Ball.
At high voltage, Magneton can release stronger waves of electromagnetic energy and radio waves that can increase temperatures up to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit with a nearby 3,300-ft. radius. It is also able to cause earaches to anyone that gets too close to it. Magneton usually appear frequently whenever sunspots flare up.

They won't eat their leeks even in intense hunger, as seen by Goh's Farfetch'd. They protect the fields in which these plants grow with their dedication, and will often fight with each other for choice stalks. Their wings have adapted to be more finger-like to enable them to grasp leeks, though some prefer hold them in their beaks instead.
Farfetch’d may actually eat their own leeks though. They will begin search endlessly for new ones immediately afterwards, however. 
",Wild Duck Pokémon,"normal,flying",2′07″,33.1
doduo,"Doduo alternately bob their heads to keep balance while running. Their two heads have identical brains (though a few with differing ones have been discovered on occasion) and can communicate ​with each other through telepathy in order to accomplish common goals. The two heads take turns sleeping; while one dozes off, the other keeps watch for any potential dangers approaching. This team effort makes it difficult to catch Doduo off-guard. To defend themselves, Doduo can attack with moves such as Double Hit and Drill Peck. They are able to use both heads at once for some moves, effectively being able to target two enemies at the same time if necessary.
",Twin Bird Pokémon,"normal,flying",4′07″,86.4
dodrio,"Each head controls a different basic emotion; one expresses joy, one sadness, and one anger. They can also use their three heads to conceive complex plans to search for food or defend themselves. However, they may occasionally over-exhaust themselves with this, and will remain motionless for extended periods of time while recovering. Their heads do argue sometimes, since the emotions they control tend to disagree. However, like many internal conflicts, these inner spats are usually solved with food. Since they share the same stomach, when one of the heads eats, the other two will be satisfied as well. Those who live near Dodrio may be woken up early in the morning by their raucous calls—they squawk at the same time every day without fail.
",Triple Bird Pokémon,"normal,flying",5′11″,187.8
seel,"Seel are vespertine Pokémon that are most active in the evening. Sometimes, one may see a Seel napping near the shoreline in the morning. When hunting, they dive underwater for extended periods of time. When they need to breathe, they surface and break through sea ice with their horns (and tusks if necessary). When Seel swim, they close their nostrils tightly to block out water. 
They are highly social Pokémon, living in large, raucous groups on ice floes in the middle of the sea. Seel may play-fight with each other on these floes, sparring with their tusks and horns as well as Water-type and sometimes Ice-type attacks. This activity is important in teaching young Seel how to defend themselves against enemies.
",Sea Lion Pokémon,water,3′07″,198.4
dewgong,"Like Seel, Dewgong prefer frigid waters. They can swim at a steady 8 knots, undeterred by the cooler temperatures around them. In fact, like their pre-evolutions, Dewgong become more active in colder waters. When resting, though they do still sometimes sleep on the ocean floor or shore like Seel, they now prefer to rest on ice floes. Recent studies show that they are in fact sunbathing while doing so, with the increased temperature aiding their digestion. There, their pristine white fur can camouflage them against predators.
Dewgong no longer use their tusks and horns to play-fight, since they stop growing at this stage. However, they are still useful for poking breathing holes into ice floes while swimming under them to resurface for air.
",Sea Lion Pokémon,"water,ice",5′07″,264.6
grimer,"It enters sewers and other areas with great ease due to its rubbery, semi-viscous body; for example, it can enter barred-off areas by slipping between the narrow bars. If one stick his/her hand in a Grimer, it will be very hard to get it out.
An Alolan Grimer is brought to the Alolan region to deal with the increase of garbage, as well as keeping the Trubbish and Garbodor populations in check. It has adapted into eating solid waste instead of liquid waste. Grimer has a huge obsession of garbage, eating huge amounts at a fast pace; eating garbage constantly has caused Grimer to form crystallized toxins in its mouth.  
",Sludge Pokémon,poison,2′11″,66.1
muk,"Muk's body contains highly noxious chemicals that can cause anyone nearby to faint. These chemicals also cause plant life to wither and die. Due to their ability to create pollution, Muk have been victims of extermination; some theorized that because of this, Muk would become extinct in the near future. To counteract this problem, people create sludge pools for Muks to live in.  
Alolan Muk, unlike its Kantonian counterpart, produces no foul-smelling odors. Instead, all of the odors are stored within Muk's body and are in turn hardened into crystal-like structures covering its mouth and body; the ""crystals"" will break apart and release dangerous toxins if removed. The reason why Alolan Muk gains its bright coloration is the large quantities of trash it consumes. Alolan Muk's body contains numerous types of poison. It also preys on Trubbish and Garbodor. Although usually friendly and laidback, an Alolan Muk would consume and destroy its trainer's household items if left unfed for a prolonged period of time.       
",Sludge Pokémon,poison,3′11″,66.1
shellder,"Shellder live on the sea floor, digging holes with their tongues and hiding in them with their tongues out to catch prey. Their tongues are never withdrawn, even when sleeping. Yanking on them will cause them to open up in shock. Shellder can move surprisingly quickly by flapping their shells. They can also lampoon prey with Icicle Spear.Shellder enjoy eating Slowpoke tail secretions and will bite these tails on sight. They then adopt a spiral shape and inject poison as the Slowpoke evolve into Slowbro. They are also oddly attracted to King’s Rocks. If a Slowpoke is wearing one, a Shellder may propel itself into the air to bite its head, triggering its evolution into a Slowking.
",Bivalve Pokémon,water,1′00″,8.8
cloyster,"To catch food, Cloyster wait on the ocean floor for prey swim by before shooting these spikes by using the move Spike Cannon. The harpooned prey then slowly float down to the waiting Cloyster. Like Shellder, Cloyster love Slowpoke tails, and may even venture onto land to seek them out. Cloyster are capable of swimming by swallowing water and jetting it out—this is the same process they use to shoot spikes. They can slam their shells shut with incredible force. Unlike Shellder, Cloyster can use clamping as a viable method of defense. Their insides are virtually untouchable while their shells are closed. Even the strongest forces cannot pry a clamped Cloyster apart; consequently, no one knows exactly what lies within their shells. It has been recently discovered that Cloyster that live in stronger currents have larger spikes, though the reason behind this is unknown. A concurrent study found that when a Cloyster shell is damaged, a new spike grows in place of the damaged area instead of recovering the flat surface.
",Bivalve Pokémon,"water,ice",4′11″,292.1
gastly,"They capture prey by enveloping them in their poisonous gas, which can seep through skin and cause fainting. They may also immobilize prey with the paralyzing move Lick. Despite their poor reputation, though, Gastly are not blatantly malicious and do not “haunt” beings with the intent of harming them. Instead, they are mischievous pranksters who enjoy startling others. They rarely utilize their poisonous gases unless threatened, but are known to put victims to sleep with Hypnosis. Their pranks can be annoying at times, so it should be noted that oscillating fans are very effective at warding Gastly away because the Pokémon steer clear of strong winds. When Gastly are near, it is said the air will smell faintly sweet.
",Gas Pokémon,"ghost,poison",4′03″,0.2
haunter,"They feed on the life force of living things, waiting in the darkness for unwary prey to wander by. Then, they sneak up on their victims and lick them. This causes uncontrollable shuddering in their prey, who are slowly drained of life until they die. Like Gastly, Haunter are also pranksters. They may trip unwary travelers or place ghostly hands on their shoulders to scare them. When a Haunter is around, those nearby feel paranoid, as if they are being watched (which they are). Haunter can also feed on fear. Though research has shown that such a diet is not very energy-efficient, it is believed that some Haunter have learned to feed on these feelings because they are “sustainable;” by not killing victims, some Haunter have successfully used cities as “farms” of sorts, scaring people as necessary and feeding on their fright. Many ghost “hot-spots” are in fact popular Haunter feeding grounds. Since Haunter detest light, well-lit towns are usually devoid of them. In some regions is said that Haunter come out on moonless nights looking for victims to lay curses on.
",Gas Pokémon,"ghost,poison",5′03″,0.2
gengar,"Gengar are typically mean-spirited and enjoy tormenting people, hurting them and overtaking them. They are most active during full moons, creeping out in the dead of night and disguising themselves as shadows; they may even enters sleeping homes to lurk in the dark. They will mimic every movement their targets make until they lower their guards. Then, they strike, draining their victims' life force as sustenance. 
Gengar are also said to attack those who are hopelessly lost and afraid in the mountains. Many Gengar have learned to feed on fear, simply following victims in the shadows and mimicking them almost, but not quite perfectly. This cultivates great paranoia in victims, which they can then feast on. Other tricks Gengar have been known to use include: laughing maniacally in the shadows, lighting their red eyes in the darkness, and chanting mysteriously in the distance. In some places, parents warn that Gengar appear at night in the bedrooms of naughty children. A famous folk tale tells of a Gengar that once used to be human, attacking people so it could have a friend.
In spite of their infamous insidiousness and cruelty, domesticated Gengar that are being kindly looked after by their trainers are much friendlier, and their smiles appear to be less creepy.

For this reason, they can sometimes be found lurking outside daycares or kindergartens during naptime.There are many “signs” people believe Drowzee leave after eating dreams. For example, an itchy nose upon waking may mean one has sucked up a dream through your nostrils, or having a good dream but not remembering it means that it has been consumed. Drowzee (save for trained ones) rarely live near people, however, preferring to feed on the dreams of Pokémon in the grasslands that they call home. They get sick from bad dreams (which are said to taste sour), so they uses their noses to differentiate between good dreams and nightmares. Trained Drowzee can show people their dreams upon awakening.

hypno,"Hypno only prey on dreams, so captives generally return physically unharmed. Their swinging pendulums cause drowsiness even in onlookers that have just awoken. The longer one stares at the mesmerizing oscillations, the longer the effect last. Hypno are reliant on their pendulums for their powers, and having it damaged or destroyed can cause severe shock and depression for them.&#91;2&#93; Trained Hypno are of great use to doctors to help treat insomnia in patients. 
In the Alola region, wild Hypno do not usually attack humans, as the perpetually sleeping Komalas are a much easier target for them.

krabby,"Krabby is an omnivore and a scavenger; it rarely hunts for itself. It can also act as a filter feeder by harmonizing bacteria in the sand, but this is rare. It is territorial, and in beaches where there is little food, fights between Krabby are common. Krabby also uses camouflage; it can form mucus sacs around itself if threatened, making it seem larger or making it harder to spot against sea sand. It is usually very small, but it makes up for this with its aggressiveness.

kingler,"Kingler possess a large pincer that boasts huge amounts of strength equal to 10,000 horsepower of crushing force. However, the pincer is quite heavy and is difficult to wield, leaving Kingler exhausted after being used. Out of battle, these large claw aren't very efficient for most everyday tasks, so they tend to use their smaller ones instead. When signaling to fellow Kingler or competing for dominance, however, they will wave their larger claws wildly in the air (a very tiring action for them).
Gigantamax Kingler is capable of producing bubbles that are high in alkaline content. Anyone who touches these bubbles will be melted down.

voltorb,"Voltorb have very volatile temperaments that induce their explosions. They are generally found in power plants and other areas with electric fields where it feeds. The species was first discovered in the plant where modern Poké Balls were invented. Notably, Alpha Sapphire 's Pokédex entry for Voltorb contains a conspiracy theory about how it was a Poké Ball exposed to an energy pulse.",Ball Pokémon,electric,1′08″,22.9
electrode,"Electrode is an unpredictable and volatile Pokémon that will explode with little or no stimuli or provocation. It stores much electricity inside its spherical body, and often drifts on winds, full to bursting with stored electricity. It is feared by many due to its explosive and unpredictable nature. 
As shown in the fourth episode of Pokémon Generations, Electrode is capable of levitating.  
These Pokémon convert solar energy into electricity and store it in their abdomens. When angered, they release this energy into currents that arc in the surrounding air, said to be equal in strength to 20 lightning bolts. After a Hisuian Electrode lets loose, the surrounding land is often totally scorched with the air still crackling, a telltale sign of its presence. If their holes are plugged, they become unable to release this energy until it builds up enough to pop the plug free. 
Hisuian Electrode, though not as irritable as their relatives, were still feared in Hisui due to their ability to destroy entire villages at once. According to legend, one settlement grew so tired of these Pokémon that they shipped them far away to a distant region, where they could never return. It is here that these Electrode grew bitter and temperamental, eventually becoming the Voltorb and Electrode common in other parts of the world.

exeggcute,"Exeggcute are actually more like seeds despite looking more like eggs. They always must be in groups of 6 to maintain balance; lone Exeggcute will quickly be joined by five others almost immediately. They can communicate with each other telepathically. If one member of a pack is threatened, the others will swarm the attacker to defend it. Some of their shells may crack as they travel. However, they are surprisingly durable Pokémon that can survive with cracked or broken shells with little problem. In fact, as these Pokémon approach evolution, these cracks become more and more common. These groups of a half-dozen each are considered one Pokémon—they all can be caught in one Poké Ball, count as one Pokémon in battle, and so forth, in part due to their “shared” minds. Since they get distressed if they are unable to have six members, it is considered abuse to force Exeggcute in groups of more or less.
",Egg Pokémon,"grass,psychic",1′04″,5.5
exeggutor,"Kantonian Exeggutor live in herds and has been given the reputation as the ""Walking Jungle"" due to them migrating sometimes. Tales have been told that one of Exeggutor's heads would fall off and form an Exeggcute, when this happens it will emit a telepathic call almost immediately to attract five other Exeggcute and become a group. The three heads of an Exeggutor always think independently and rarely bicker with one another. Exeggutor having a stout body is the result of cooler climates. Their three heads each speak their minds all at once. As a result, Exeggutor can be very noisy at times. They use telepathy to plan amongst themselves before acting. They are very friendly, both between their heads and to others, so it is rare for them to ever argue. When they do, however, Exeggutor will become confused, especially if they try to move in different directions at once. Though not aggressive, Exeggutor are capable of defending themselves when attacked with a variety of moves, including techniques such as Egg Bomb and the rare Barrage. Focusing on the same target with all three ends results in a triple-strength attack. They are rarely threatened, though, as their herds give them strength in numbers; few ever want to anger entire “forests.” Exeggutor become quite sluggish when deprived of sunlight, and forests of them will quiet down on cloudy days.
Alolan Exeggutor thrives well in the Alola region. The locals there often take pride in Exeggutor, stating that it was originally meant to look like the taller appearance it bears in Alola. Exeggutors living in Alola have given up their psychic powers in exchange for draconic powers that have been long dormant for many years. The main reason for Exeggutor gaining Dragon-type powers is the strong sunlight from Alola.These heads help them spot opponents sneaking up from behind, though they can also attack as well if necessary. Though most predators stay far away from these giant Pokémon, some have learned to take advantage of their height, zipping around their feet until they loose balance and keel over. They attack foes by swinging around their heads like giant whips, though this action makes them dizzy as well.

cubone,"Cubone appears to be based on a bipedal dinosaur of some kind combined with a stereotypical caveman.
Cubone, known as the Lonely Pokémon, appears to be a small, brown, dinosaur-like Pokémon that constantly wears its skull like helmet. The skull masks its true face from view, which makes it a puzzlement for many Trainers and researchers. Its cries echo within the skull and it comes out as a pained and sad melody. On the night of a full moon, it cries, for it seems to recognize its mother's face in the moon. Its tears create stains on the skull. Cubone has a plump body with a paler-colored underbelly, with strong, clawed limbs to carry a bone as a weapon around wherever it goes. Cubone has a single, nailed toe on each foot, with two spikes on its back. A small tail is also present for balance, but it can be used for attacking.",Lonely Pokémon,ground,1′04″,14.3
marowak,"Marowak no longer grieve about abandonment; instead, their traumatic pasts become fuel for ruthless combat. They use bones to defeat foes with moves like Bone Club and Bonemerang. Marowak possess homing instincts that lead them back to their mothers’ tribes. They will join these tribes, never learning who their mothers truly were. Their loneliness has hardened them towards all deep social connections. Marowak will often fight one another in these tribes to the death for especially prized bones. The loser's remains will supply tools for future Cubone. The abandonment of young is a coming-of-age for Marowak. Lone Cubone, though traumatized, return home as cold, ruthless fighters who have no qualms whatsoever about brutally beating or killing others. Marowak hardly even communicate with each other, and even more rarely do so with speech. They tap their bones on boulders in specific rhythms to send messages. There are known to be over 50 of these unique rhythms. These Pokémon despise Mandibuzz, who try to steal their prized bones, and will throw their bones at them to knock them out of the sky. In popular folklore where Cubone are believed to be wearing the skulls of their mothers, Marowak are spurred on to defend their bones by their desire to avenge their deceased parent.
Such extreme pressure also favored individuals that worked together (in contrast to the distant relations of mainland Marowak). These Pokémon maintain the tradition of passing down the bones of loved ones; rather than dueling over them, however, Alolan Marowak seem to choose 'heirs' that will have the honor of wielding their bones when they pass. These Pokémon remain close with one another for their whole lives. They hold elaborate mourning rituals involving their flaming bones for their fallen allies; though their bones may be repurposed, Alolan Marowak will create dirt mound 'graves' along the sides of roads, fiercely attacking those who disturb them. It is said that their undying loyalty for one another endures even through death, with their spirits protecting those wielding their bones and granting them 'sixth senses.' Alolan people refer to and fear these Pokémon as 'conjurers of the dead' for this reason. Alolan Marowak strike their bones on the black patches on their heads to ignite them. They spin their bones and perform intricate dances to perform both rituals and attacks. They can release fireballs in this manner; while not individually strong, their determination to land repeated blows can make them formidable foes. It is said that a blaze caused by its ghostly fire cannot be quenched, no matter how much water is poured over it. Their flames are said to scorch both the mind and body equally.
Marowak are usually seen living in caves and grasslands, though some might be living in deserts.

hitmonlee,"Hitmonlee and their relatives Hitmonchan and Hitmontop are found in cites, training peacefully alongside humans. They also occasionally head to mountains to train, though they generally return to urban areas at night. After tough training sessions, Hitmonlee will often massage their legs to prevent fatigue. They can often be found in dojos, teaching people how to deliver devastating kicks as well as learning new, unorthodox techniques from them.

hitmonchan,"Hitmonchan is an extremely resilient Pokémon who won't give up in the face of challenges. Any Hitmonchan may appear to be standing idly when in fact launching volleys of punches faster than bullet trains into thin air as practice. However, these punches do tire them out—after three minutes of intense work, they need to take light rests. Regardless of the setbacks they face, Hitmonchan are determined, having the spirit of champion boxers. Even during these breaks, Hitmonchan will often move around or jog quickly in place.
They are also skilled in sparring with light punches, allowing them to act as a sparring partners to fellow Hitmonchan or to aspiring human boxers (the latter of which who almost always lose, but learn from fights nonetheless). Like Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan can be found training in dojos, but can also sometimes be seen punching away at boulders in mountains.

When they come across unfamiliar objects, they will lick them, as they associate things by texture and taste. Lickitung do not enjoy sourness, however, and will avoid things that are tart. Though Lickitung often chase down people and Pokémon, they are not aggressive. In addition to using their tongues to feel new things, they also use them to detect food particles on others and lick them off to ""clean"" them, though this always leaves a rather unpleasant odor behind.

Just like its pre-evolved form, Weezing is able to hover in the air. Despite smelling horrible, the gases that Weezing creates have been used for perfumes.
Weezing is fond of garbage and other sources of pollution; it is mainly nocturnal, always looking for trash from a human's house.
The gases produced from a Kantonian Weezing is much more potent than the gases from a Galarian Weezing.

They will often charge at something but forget why they began charging in the first place mid-run; they will not stop running until they tire out and collapse from exhaustion, however. Sometimes, destroying things help Rhyhorn remember why they began running. 
Rhyhorn can be very friendly and playful but if approached from behind they may get startled and run as they have a blind spot directly behind them, like horses do. They will gladly allow their trainers to ride on their backs; in some regions, Rhyhorn racing is a popular sport.

Their vines never stop growing and can regenerate. This allows Tangela to snap off vines painlessly to distract predators and regrow them later as soon as the next day.
Their vines have a distinctive scent and are used as an herb in some parts of Galar. The swaying of their vines can be mysteriously unnerving to onlookers. Their vines are covered in fine hairs that tickle those caught within and also allow Tangela to use their vines as arms; the hairs can “feel” objects when brushed against them and detect ​changes in air pressure and humidity.
Their vines latch onto anything that moves. If Tangela grab foes that turn out to be too strong, their vines will break off and allow them to escape.

When they are a safe location, they can be seen playfully tangling their tails together. Horsea do like swimming around, making them adept in using their fin. If the ocean current turns fast, however, Horsea will anchor itself by wrapping its tail around rocks or coral to prevent being washed away. It also has the ability to spit ink to escape any potential danger, because of this it can learn moves such as Smokescreen. They have been known to make their nests in the shades of corals.

They swallow ​food whole using their long snouts, and can even suck in prey larger than these openings with great force.

staryu,"Staryu are mysterious Pokémon that lie on the seabed during the day and float up to the surface at night. For this reason, Pokémon like Lumineon often nibble on them as a reliable source of food. 
Even a Staryu cut into pieces can regenerate as long as its core is intact. Their centers are vital to their survival and are irreplaceable. These cores glow brightly at night when Staryu are active, whereas the cores of sick Staryu glow faintly and flicker. 
Staryu mostly live by the seashore in large numbers. Groups of Staryu, referred to as ""constellations"", rise to the surface each night, cores aglow. They seem to float aimlessly (though they are actually filter-feeding), gazing at the stars. Their cores mysteriously pulse at the same rate as a human's resting heartbeat. From above, oceans with large numbers of Staryu seem to mimic and align with the twinkling skies above. However, Staryu only become active if the stars are visible; if clouds obscure the night sky, they will stay on the sea floor and their cores will not light up.

scyther,"Scyther is an adept hunter that tears at its prey with its scythes. Thanks to its green coloration, it can camouflage itself well in the grasslands and forests where it lives. Humans rarely encounter wild Scyther in these areas, however. Said to be like a ninja, Scyther can move so quickly that it cannot be followed, increasing the effectiveness of its scythes. It maintains the sharpness of its blades through battle as well as by cutting through hard objects, such as trees; it can cut down a massive tree with just a single slice.
Wild Scyther form swarms with a single leader chosen through combat. When a challenger successfully defeats a current leader and replaced it, the defeated leader is exiled from the swarm. It has also been shown that Scyther becomes more aggressive than those of the swarm. Groves of cleanly-cut stumps are a sign of Scyther pack territory.

jynx,"Jynx are found in secluded, snowy areas. Though rare, they seem to become more common during strong blizzards. As Jynx walk, they sway their hips alluringly. Depending on their emotions, they may move in slightly different manners. Their strange movements compel those who see them to move with them, dancing in unison. Those moving may not even realize they are swaying their hips until someone else (who is probably also dancing) points it out to them. Jynx use their dancing to talk to one another. 
However, they also have a form of oral speech, which sounds ​uncannily similar to a foreign human language. For this reason, some musicians have written songs specifically for Jynx to sing. Despite their curious behavior, Jynx are kind Pokémon. As they walk and sway, people and Pokémon alike subconsciously follow them. During blizzards, they will often lead these hypnotized beings to safety away from the cold. Then, they disappear almost as quickly as they appeared. When Jynx walk, they mysteriously leave no footprints in the snow. In rural, barren regions of Galar, Jynx are known in folklore as Queens of Ice and are worshiped for their beautiful singing and dancing.

Despite this nature, they grow weak in cold environments and will bury into dirt, sand, or leaves with their two pincers sticking up from the ground. They are also known to enjoy tree sap and Honey like many other Bug-type Pokémon. Pinsir lives deep in the temperate forests and jungles, where it burrows underground or hides in the treetops on nights cold enough to render it immobile. They tend to group together as a result.
In the Alola region, they are known to get along well with Heracross while they have a strong rivalry with Vikavolt.
The size of their pincers are used to judge attractiveness, the bigger the more attractive.
When they mega evolve, Pinsir appears to be in a constant state of excitement and rarely touches the ground due to its newfound flight.

tauros,"Tauros is a violent, rowdy Pokémon that whips itself into a frenzy using its three tails. It serves as a warning to others that Tauros is about to charge with astonishing speed. Once it starts charging, it is unable to stop or change course until it hits something. It will lock horns with others of its kind, and the herd's protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns. While still ferocious, Tauros are calmer in Alola than elsewhere, likely due to the region's climate. The practice of riding Tauros is believed to have started in Alola. However, Tauros in Galar are more volatile and don't want to be ridden.
In Paldea, Tauros are bred into three different subspecies (Combat, Blaze, and Aqua), each with specific traits. 
Combat Breed Tauros are fierce and possess a muscular build. They are experts of close-ranged combat and will use their horns to strike at the enemy's weak spot. 
Blaze Breed Tauros are well named from their ability to emit superheated air from their nostrils. They are also able to increase the temperature of their horns to a blistering 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. The horns leave the opponent with burn marks and wounds. The tails of a Blaze Breed Tauros are unique in that they are intertwined rather than separated. 
Aqua Breed Tauros has more body fat, which allows them to easily float on the water's surface. Their horns are capable of expelling high pressurized water jets that not only aid in propulsion but also have enough strength to pierce through enemy defenses.

Although they can reach heights of 7 feet using this move, they are unable to change direction in the air, so they land in the exact same place. Legend has it that older Magikarp can splash over mountains, though this has never been seen. In fact, splashing Magikarp actually make easy prey for Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto, who can snatch them up as they bounce. They are also weak swimmers, unable to swim through even weak currents. As a result, many of them congregate in small ponds or lakes, unable swim through river currents. Magikarp are very hardy, however, with strong survival instincts and immune systems. They are able to tolerate waters of nearly any salinity, depth, and pollution level.

gyarados,"Contrary to their pre-evolution Magikarp, Gyarados are known to be extremely violent, often flying into an Outrage and destroying anything they see. This includes small towns that stand on their wake. This is likely due to them having undergone structural brain transformation that stimulated their brain cells, leading to them becoming ferocious.
Mega Gyarados are monstrously destructive creatures due to the stress imposed on their brains by Mega Evolution, leaving them of nearly nothing but the dangerous instinct to raze everything into cinders.
Despite their violent disposition, Gyarados can be obedient to trainers that they love and trust and can be very misunderstood; they never intentionally destroy things and instead they just have anger problems. When they aren't angry, they are actually quite timid and gentle for a short-tempered sea serpent. 
Gyarados in the Alola region will flee upon seeing a school of Wishiwashi.

Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pokémon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pokémon, it is able to understand human speech. Lapras have been known to travel in large pods across the seas, spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with other of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies.

Because of its eating habits, it can interfere with human farming by destroying crops for food, but it is also believed to release a kind of energy to help new plants grow wherever it ate.

In the wild, it will ignore most people and Pokémon while it is eating or sleeping, but tends to be very affectionate towards its Trainer after being caught.

However, they generally only use this to travel from shallow reefs to deep sea floors, and vice versa; they conserve energy by walking rather than swimming when hunting. Unlike their pre-evolutions, however, Omastar are hunters, capturing prey such as the prehistoric ancestors of modern-day Shellder. Once they latch onto their prey with their tentacles, they will never let go unless their arms are severed off. They can regenerate their tentacles over the course of a few weeks. Omastar crack open shells using ​their beak-like mouths, sucking out the innards of their prey. Omastar can also launch the spikes on their shells at foes. However, it can take weeks for these spikes to grow back, leaving vulnerable holes in the meantime. It is believed that cooling oceans were the reason that Omastar became extinct. Their prey began moving to warmer equatorial waters, but their own heavy shells prevented them from keeping up with their food supply.

Kabutops can also leave the water and walk on land for extended periods of time, up to 12 hours in humid environments.

They attack from above, tearing out the necks of victims with their teeth. Some research has shown that they may be loosely linked to modern-day Dragon-types. Though superb fliers, they were actually quite slow and clumsy on land. Surprisingly, Aerodactyl are omnivores, eating various fruits and Berries in addition to meat. They seem to especially enjoy Pamtre Berries, perhaps because these Berries are closely related to an ancient fruit they consumed long ago. Aerodactyl also love Aspear Berries, though no studies have linked them to any fruits from when Aerodactyl were alive.

snorlax,"Snorlax is known for its relaxed and somewhat-sluggish nature. It will sleep all day until it is hungry, when it will awake and forage for the 880 pounds (399 kilograms) of food it needs, afterwards falling back to sleep again. Because of its eating habits, it can interfere with human farming by destroying crops for food, but it is also believed to release a kind of energy to help new plants grow wherever it ate.
In the wild, it will ignore most people and Pokémon while it is eating or sleeping, but tends to be very affectionate towards its Trainer after being caught. Waking up a sleeping Snorlax, however, will turn these normally docile Pokémon into aggressive attackers whether one is wild or domesticated.

",Freeze Pokémon,"ice,flying",5′07″,122.1
zapdos,"When Zapdos flaps its glittering wings, it releases electricity that can potentially cause thunderstorms. It produces massive crackling and snapping sounds when it flies; these are attributed to the lightning bolts it sheds when airborne. When stricken by lightning, it gains power. Zapdos reportedly appears only during thunderstorms, and is said to live among thunderclouds. However, it is rarely seen.
",Electric Pokémon,"electric,flying",5′03″,116
moltres,"Moltres sheds embers with every flap of its wings, creating a brilliant flash of flames. By dipping itself into the magma of an active volcano, this Pokémon can heal itself. It migrates to the south with the coming of spring and is said to bring an early springtime to cold lands. However, it is rarely seen in normal occasions.
",Flame Pokémon,"fire,flying",6′07″,132.3
dratini,"Dratini dwell at the bottoms of deep lakes, where they are difficult to find. Young Dratini are rather large for newborns, with some having been reported be be as long as 6.5 feet (2 meters). As they age, they grow even larger, shedding their skins periodically (sometimes as often as every day). They are extremely vulnerable after shedding, so they will hide behind powerful waterfalls away from their colonies during these times. Their bodies grow at an astounding rate, so they must shed often. These skins were likely the source of myths regarding mysterious, lake-dwelling, serpentine creatures. 
For a long time, people were convinced that the these skins were hoaxes. It was not until scientists compared their DNA to that of actual Dratini was finally accepted that not only were the skins authentic, but that Dratini were real as well; coupled with how a fisherman had a 10-hour struggle with a Dratini to confirm this species' existence. Today, shed Dratini skin are often treated to make luxury leather goods. 
",Dragon Pokémon,dragon,5′11″,7.3
dragonair,"Dragonair are wary Pokémon. They are quick to respond to perceived threats, and they tend to flee when they sense danger. Dragonair shed their skin periodically, but not as frequently as Dratini. These skins were at first mistaken for huge Dratini, and fetched hefty sums as collectors clamored over them. According to popular legend, seeing a Dragonair flying overhead at the start of a new year is a sign of good health for the rest of the year.
Dragonair live in the bottoms of many lakes, but they usually never come to the surface.
",Dragon Pokémon,dragon,13′01″,36.4
dragonite,"Most Dragonite are incredibly warmhearted as well as selfless and will rescue anyone lost at sea. However, as shown in one episode, they will go on a rampage if their environment is harmed. They tend to battle Kingdra, their sworn rivals, in the wild.
",Dragon Pokémon,"dragon,flying",7′03″,463
mewtwo,"As evidence of its immense power, Mewtwo is by far one of the most domineering Pokémon in the series. Its power is so great to the point where it can endure immense torture in Mewtwo Returns, and teleport a lake miles long underground. Proven in the first Pokémon Movie, Mewtwo holds a large degree of pride in its personality. In fact, its general nature is so complex that it borderlines that of human levels with itself capable of learning and evolving just to get the upper hand in battle.
",Genetic Pokémon,psychic,6′07″,269
mew,"Despite being one of the most powerful Pokémon in the world, Mew is very playful and mischievous. It can get along with many different humans and Pokémon and will risk its life for its friends. However, Mew is very shy and will only show itself to those pure of heart, like Ash.
",New Species Pokémon,psychic,1′04″,8.8
chikorita,"Chikorita are docile and friendly, spending a lot of time in the sun to soak up the sun's rays. Because of this, they spend most of their time peacefully sunbathing. Their leaves are highly sensitive to temperature and humidity. They love bright, sunny weather--in fact, one of the only times trainers may their see Chikorita upset is when the Pokémon are prevented from going out on beautiful days.
One loves to be pet on its leaf, unlike the buds on its neck.Thanks to their calm nature, it is no surprise that Chikorita continue to be popular Johtonian starter Pokémon.
",Leaf Pokémon,grass,2′11″,14.1
bayleef,"It is very outgoing like Chikorita, but more cautious. It looks up to Meganium and other grass types for knowledge. It will hide from danger and have its mother fend for her young. If anything were to happen to the mother, it won't take care of its siblings, and rather join other grass types for protection, or join a herd of traveling Meganium. There have been instances where Chikorita joined groups of Jumpluff for help. Bayleef often can fend for themselves.
",Leaf Pokémon,grass,3′11″,34.8
meganium,"Meganium is a calm, peaceful Pokémon. In battle, it releases a special aroma from its petals that allows it to calm aggressive emotions and stop needless fights.
Owing to the fact that its pre-evolved form Chikorita loves sunbathing and soaking up sunlight, Meganium can be found in sunny places such as plains and grasslands. This is backed up by the Pokédex in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen and their Friend Area preference.
the grasslands in which these Pokémon are rarely found in the wild are beautifully vibrant as a result. They communicate by releasing various scents and waving the stamens on their heads.
Meganium remain extremely affectionate and defensive of their trainers, which is why they are worthy choices for any trainers looking forward to starting their journeys in the Johto region.
",Herb Pokémon,grass,5′11″,221.6
cyndaquil,"Cyndaquil are generally timid and not naturally aggressive, and are often seen curled up into a ball for protection. This action leaves their backs and special flame-emitting vent fur exposed. 
Cyndaquil are also seen to have a shrill voice. When predators and enemies stalk too close, Cyndaquil unleash a flame from the vents as a deterrent. If provoked further, Cyndaquil will intensify their flames, creating a smokescreen that they use to confuse their foe, making time to escape. They burn vigorously most of the time, but will sputter and die out sporadically if the Pokémon are tired. They rarely fight back, due to their flighty natures, but may attack with Ember or Swift when cornered. 
Trainers must be careful when raising Cyndaquil, as they are easily startled—frightened Cyndaquil will instinctively flare up their backs. Despite this potential problem, they can be very playful and cheerful, if a bit skittish. It is said that trainers who choose Cyndaquil at the beginning of their journeys also tend to be good caretakers of children, especially younger, timid ones.
",Fire Mouse Pokémon,fire,1′08″,17.4
quilava,"Quilava retain the general personalities that they had as Cyndaquil, but replace their skittishness with caution. They are extremely wary of new situations, and will react to nearly any sign of danger. However, instead of curling up into balls, Quilava prefer to fight back. Before a battle, a Quilava usually turns its back on its opponents to attack with its flames. 
Quilava are also very agile, allowing them to maneuver around attacks thrown at them. They can utilize the move Flame Wheel to defend themselves, leaving behind lingering trails of fire that provide barriers against opponents. In fact, these lines of scorched earth are often signs that a Quilava has recently been in the area. 
",Volcano Pokémon,fire,2′11″,41.9
typhlosion,"Typhlosion are known to be barbarian and ferocious, and extremely temperamental. Their flames burn intensely whenever they are infuriated, and can cause serious degrees of burn on anyone who provokes them.They are extremely territorial and will not hesitate to attack anything that enters their domains with the powerful Eruption. Brutal fights between two Typhlosion over territory can sometimes devastate acres of grasslands. These Pokémon will flare up their manes to determine dominance; the individuals with larger manes gain control of the land, unless the losers decide to fight it out in battle. Females are highly protective of their young, caring for them until adolescence, and will destroy anything they see as threats to them. Despite their aggressive tendencies, Typhlosion are also extremely loyal and will defend their trainers with all their strength, making them strong choices for starters. 
",Volcano Pokémon,fire,5′07″,175.3
totodile,"Totodile are very energetic, cheerful and rowdy, and occasionally can be seen running through swampy areas, biting and chomping at everything that moves around them.They will snap at the arms and legs of people when they lower their guards to “investigate” the foreign beings. Though they are simply “playing,” these bites can cause serious injury, sometimes even resulting in fractured bones. Even trained Totodile may occasionally crunch on and destroy possessions like watches, bags, phones, and on at least one recorded occasion, Pokédexes. Due to these potential obstacles, Totodile are often seen as the hardest, though perhaps the most rewarding, to raise Johto starters.

feraligatr,"Feraligatr opens its powerful jaws to intimidate its foes and viciously shakes its head once it clamps down on foes or prey. Because it has difficulty supporting its weight out of the water, it has been known to move on all fours.They can intimidate foes simply by opening their giant mouths and roaring; this display, along with the size of the red crests on their heads, is also used in displays of dominance.However, when hunting or fighting, it is agile and fast, due to its powerful hind legs. Feraligatr can rarely be found living near the water's edge.For trainers who are willing to endure the antics of their pre-evolutions, the brute strength and power of Feraligatr makes them great candidates for starter Pokémon in Johto.
",Big Jaw Pokémon,water,7′07″,195.8
sentret,"Sentret are very wary Pokémon and will cry out loud to warn its species of any danger. In order to sleep, they will take shifts guarding one another. If one is separated from the pack, it will remain awake due to fear,loneliness and  the constant, instinctual need to have an ally on guard duty—without anyone to split their patrols with, lone Sentret feel compelled to stay up and keep watch indefinitely all by themselves until they simply collapse from sheer exhaustion.They are very nervous Pokémon—upon the first sign of trouble, they will begin thumping their tails wildly and crying out to alert their allies. Sentret care closely for and are heavily dependent upon their friends.
",Scout Pokémon,normal,2′07″,13.2
furret,"Furret enjoy chasing Rattata. To put their babies to sleep, a mother Furret will curl up around them. Furret tend to stray away from their social groups, though they stay within the general area of their peers and often are seen meeting for “get-togethers” with them. Instead of groups, Furret choose to settle down with mates for life, making nests in narrow burrows that only they can fit into; these burrows are often maze-like in order to confuse potential predators looking for their offspring.

noctowl,"Noctowl is a nocturnal Pokémon that is called ""the emperor of dark nights"" by some. It has exceptional eyes that concentrate the faintest light and give it night vision, supple wings capable of silent flight, and it can twist its head at a 180-degree angle to increase its intellect. Its superior senses and intellect allow it to catch prey without fail in the darkness. It can also turn its head upside down, which signals that it is troubled by something. If disturbed in this state, it will peck at the offender.
",Owl Pokémon,"normal,flying",5′03″,89.9
ledyba,"Ledyba are social Pokémon that live in large swarms. They are very active, flying constantly about forests. However, when separated from their friends, they become withdrawn, not eating, drinking, or sleeping until reunited. Their feet secrete odorous fluids that they use to communicate with others; a sour smell signals anger, for instance. When temperatures drop, swarms will congregate together on lone trees, huddling together for warmth. They will use Reflect en-masse to protect their nests when in danger. Ledyba are major pollinators in forests; as their swarms flit about, they pollinate hundreds of flowers along the way. Their activity directly correlates with higher temperatures, being most active in the summer as well as in warm regions like Alola. Many gardeners release Ledyba swarms numbering in the thousands into their orchards to pollinate at the blow of a whistle. In exchange, they get a portion of the crop produced. Ledyba are strictly diurnal and are almost never seen being active at night. Curiously, they always sleep with their backs faced towards the stars; the coloration of the patterns on their their backs seem to be more vivid during these periods of time. Individual Ledyba seem to have different patterns.
",Five Star Pokémon,"bug,flying",3′03″,23.8
ledian,"Ledian is a nocturnal insect, active mainly during the night and sleeping in curled-up leaves during the day. Countless Ledian live in outdoor areas located a good distance away from the polluted atmospheres of cities, for the star-lit skies are always clearer in these clean lands than in the light pollution of urban areas. Ledian have an affinity to stars for good reason; They take their energy from the light of the stars in order to live healthily. When many stars are visible, the Ledian will sprinkle a mysterious, glowing powder whilst fluttering about.

crobat,"Despite having a fierce appearance, it actually has a docile nature and doesn't become enraged easily, as long as it doesn't get disturbed when sleeping in daytime.
Crobat leave their caves at night, flying silently in the darkness in search of food. When dawn arrives, Crobat will either return to their caves or hang from under tree branches, wrapping their wings around themselves until the sun sets again.
For unknown reasons, Crobat in the Alolan region are an exception to this, and have been known to attack unwary travelers.  
In other regions, Crobat prefer to feast on insects and small rodents, subduing them with poison before draining them of blood them. They are also known to enjoy fruit and Berries, but like Golbat, avoid Durin Berries at all costs.

chinchou,"Chinchou can release negatively charged electricity from its antennas as means of hunting, self-defense, and communication.These Pokémon lives in schools of 20-30 individuals, though numerous groups numbering in the hundreds have been recorded during mating season. During this time, Chinchou head onto land en masse, where they perform intricate mating rituals involving the flashing and waving of their bulbs in patterns. People often come to see these spectacles, splashing Chinchou with water as they trek further inland to keep them hydrated. At the ends of these rituals, pairs of Chinchou head back into the water, lighting up the sea beautifully.

However, Togepi is always at risk of being forgotten during a crisis, so it needs extremely cautious protection by its guardians and trainers.
",Spike Ball Pokémon,fairy,1′00″,3.3

In order to share the happiness, they fly around the world looking for good people. If they don't stay with good people, they will become very frustrated.
",Happiness Pokémon,"fairy,flying",2′00″,7.1
natu,"Because their wings are not yet fully developed, Natu are unable to fly, spending most of their time hopping and skipping around on the ground. They forage for food in shrubs and bushes, occasionally climbing onto branches to peck at shoots. Natu are also fond of cactus plants and can deftly hop between spines to reach the fruit of these plants without injuring themselves. It should be noted that Natu never blink; they have the habit of staring at objects motionlessly for long periods of time until the objects stir.
Natu are also very cautious Pokémon. Some believe that this is due in part to their supposed future-seeing, prophetic abilities. Indeed, many locals in the rainforests Natu call home use them as early warning systems for disasters. When large flocks of Natu flee from an area, people will begin preparing for imminent flash floods or earthquakes.
",Tiny Bird Pokémon,"psychic,flying",0′08″,4.4
xatu,"On the rare occasions that Xatu do move, they simply will raise their wings in patterns to communicate. Prophets trained to read these messages herald them as predictions of the future, which come true with varying degrees of success. Whether this disparity is due to the Xatu's mistakes or the prophets’ is up to debate.
What they see is said to frighten them immensely, petrifying them. This myth explains why Xatu sometimes don't move or blink for long periods of time. Alternatively, some say that Xatu rarely move because they believe their actions are futile in the face of an inevitable future. They are virtually expressionless and don't visibly react to pain or pleasure. They seem to become ever-so-slightly agitated if they are physically prevented from completing their wing messages, however.
",Mystic Pokémon,"psychic,flying",4′11″,33.1
mareep,"Mareep are a common sight on farms, raised for their soft, fluffy wool. Their wool is used to make various different articles of clothing like jackets and sweaters, though it must first be treated to reduce its static-generating properties. Their coats grows continuously, but are shed periodically every summer. If sheared, this wool can grow back within a week. Their fur stores pockets of air that insulate them, keeping Mareep warm during colder months are cool during hotter ones. As they wander about, their wool, which generates static very easily, rubs together and begins storing electricity. Their coats will double in size once fully charged. Because touching their wool in this state would lead to a nasty shock, it is necessary for ranch hands to don rubber gloves while shearing or otherwise handling flocks of Mareep. The small orbs at the end of their tails will glow more brightly depending on how much static electricity they have charged up in their wool. Experienced trainers and farm workers will know on sight whether or not a Mareep is safe to touch, depending on the intensity of its bulb.

",Wool Pokémon,electric,2′07″,29.3
ampharos,"Ampharos is a gentle Pokémon that spends most of its time grazing in flocks of other Ampharos and its pre-evolutions, Mareep and Flaaffy. Because its tail glows brightly, in times of emergency it uses its tail as a beacon in the place of a lighthouse.The brighter the light, the healthier the individual. On the other hand. flickering, dimly glowing lights are signals of sickness or exhaustion. In the wild, these Pokémon usually keep their tails unlit to avoid detection from enemies. Lighthouses using Ampharos are legally required to have at least 3 of them at any given time to prevent any of them from being fatigued. 
",Light Pokémon,electric,4′07″,135.6

",Flower Pokémon,grass,1′04″,12.8
marill,"A Marill uses its tail to ensure it doesn't drown during its swim, as well as avoid getting washed away by strong currents by wrapping itself around a tree.
Marill can be found swimming in various bodies of freshwater as also well as frolicking on lakeshores and riversides. Their spherical tails, which contained nutrition as Azurill, now contain an oil that is less dense than water. They act as buoys when Marill swim, helping them stay afloat even in the roughest currents. The amount of oil in their tails can be regulated to allow the Pokémon to swim at varying depths.
Marill eat both underwater plants and occasionally fish for food. When fishing, these Pokémon will wrap their tails tightly around nearby trees and leap into the rushing rapids of rivers. After nabbing fish, Marill will pull themselves back onto land with their springy tails. Their ears are highly developed and can pick up minute sounds both above and below the the surface of the water.

sudowoodo,"Sudowoodo are often mistaken for trees or Grass-types—in fact, this is their greatest defense. In reality, Sudowoodo are Rock-types, mimicking trees to camouflage in forests. Their disguises can fool Grass-, Ground, and Water-types into overlooking them. Additionally, they are also resistant to Flying-, Fire-, and Poison-types, which true Grass-types are weak to. They can be found blending in with trees in forests and parks. Despite their mimicry, however, a few key tell-tale signs can help trainers distinguish ordinary trees from hidden Sudowoodo. On windless days, trees whose branches shudder erratically are often Sudowoodo. After a fresh fall of winter snow, trees that are oddly bare while their surroundings are blanketed in white are also likely Sudowoodo. Finally, Sudowoodo are very hydrophobic—they are deathly afraid of water. They will charge out of hiding if exposed to the substance. If they even sense rain, they will immediately seek shelter elsewhere. Their arms are quite strong, yet flexible, allowing them to hold them up for incredibly long periods of time. Sudowoodo seem to be popular amongst the elderly, who are very particular about their arm lengths and angles; those with larger green orbs are more desirable.
",Imitation Pokémon,rock,3′11″,83.8
politoed,"Politoed are jovial Pokémon, often seen clapping and hopping around ponds. They congregate in triplets or quartets (colloquially known as “choruses”) and sing together; their harsh croaking sounds like rumbling bellows or even screaming when they do so. Despite this, there is a famous Johtonian composer who wrote a haunting ballad based on the sounds of a Politoed chorus.
Lone Politoed are often the heads of local communities of Poliwag and Poliwhirl, commanding them sternly with their croaks. Male Politoed croak louder than females, and deeper, more resonant male croaking. The curls on their heads are symbols of dominance. When their positions are challenged by intruding or recently evolved Politoed, the ones with larger curls ultimately become the leaders. Politoed with short curls or curls lost in battle have been observed to command little to no respect from their peers; their bellows will simply be ignored. Politoed are equally adept in the water as they are on land. Because of their porous skin, they must return into the water at least once every 24 hours in order to rehydrate themselves. When choruses of least four Politoed are observed singing together, it is said that rainstorms are imminent. Their cheeks will also inflate slightly before drizzles.
",Frog Pokémon,water,3′07″,74.7
hoppip,"Hoppip also gather in large clusters for stability during strong gales, linking their leaves together to form tightly interwoven chains. These clusters can number anywhere from 10 to 100, with colonies of over a thousand having been reported during strong tropical windstorms. Clusters that are blown loose may float aimlessly across the sky like aerial tumbleweeds. Due to their docile natures, Hoppip unfortunately make easy prey for many predators. However, the leaves on their heads are unimaginably bitter, so few dare to consume them. It is said that their astringency can linger in the mouth for a week, and no amount of purging can remove or mask the taste. 
",Cottonweed Pokémon,"grass,flying",1′04″,1.1
skiploom,"Like its pre-evolution, Hoppip, a Skiploom relies on the wind to fly. They ride the wind to get closer to the sun, where their petals will open to allow them to absorb sunlight and photosynthesize. Depending on the temperature, their flowers will open up to various degrees; they fully bloom at 64&#160;°F (18&#160;°C). Because of this, some trainers use Skiploom as natural thermometers, gauging the air temperature based on how open their flowers are. 
In particularly cold weather, their flowers close up completely and their floating abilities are severely hampered. Excessive water can also be detrimental to Skiploom. Because they cannot remain airborne when soaked, they will hide in the shade of trees during rainfalls to avoid getting wet. 
They are naturally easygoing and friendly Pokémon. Skiploom rarely attack, even when threatened, instead preferring to escape on the next breeze.
",Cottonweed Pokémon,"grass,flying",2′00″,2.2
jumpluff,"Jumpluff are known to be timid, but will fight if necessary. Despite its appearance, Jumpluff are vicious fighters. They slap with their puffy arms and spray spores and powders. They also hail bullet seeds on oppressors, and favor to drain their foes' energy by sucking the life out of them by means of casting green lightning bolts from their top ""pluff"" and striking their opponent and stealing their energy. They ruthlessly defend young Hoppip, but often bully Skiploom. Many floating herds consist of only Jumpluff and Hoppip, for Skiploom are sent off on their own so they can independently train and learn to stand their ground without the help of the herd. Jumpluff are often raised from Hoppip and trained to protect gardens.
They often live in floral fields, but mostly migrate from one region to another through the seasonal winds. However, once their cotton spores are depleted, both their journey and lives will come to an end.
",Cottonweed Pokémon,"grass,flying",2′07″,6.6
aipom,"Aipom is a type of monkey that spends most of its time in the trees. It uses its tail to swing from tree to tree, picking fruit, and handling other objects. Because its tail gets so much more use, its hands are less dexterous a result. It is also very mischievous, and it steals items from passersby simply to annoy them.
Aipom use their tails to grab hard-to-reach fruit in trees, and may even shake some fruit off of their branches for younger Aipom below to enjoy. 
Their tails are also used to keep them balanced. Aipom use their tails so extensively and exclusively, in fact, that their true hands have become vestigial and more or less useless over many years of evolution.
",Long Tail Pokémon,normal,2′07″,25.4
sunkern,"Sunkern's entire life is centered around its evolution into a Sunflora. It moves as little as possible, trying to preserve the energy and nutrients it requires for the evolution process. If attacked, they likely will only attempt to shake their leaves weakly at their opponents. They often will seek shelter and protection within treetops, nestling themselves in the nooks and crannies of branches and leaves. In the morning, Sunkern can commonly be seen dropping ​down onto the ground out of the blue, blown off by strong breezes. They rely almost entirely on the sun, its light, and its warmth to supply the primary factors in their growths. During cooler, cloudier summers, Sunkern will go into hibernation and seem to disappear entirely. Then, the following year, if the summer weather improves, Sunkern populations will appear to explode as masses of hibernating Sunkern reawaken to bask in the warm sunlight.

yanma,"Yanma are some of the most agile fliers in the world. They can fly in any direction: forwards, backwards, up, down, left, and right; they can even hover in place. They flap their wings extremely quickly; to defend themselves, Yanma can increase the speed of their flapping to generate shock waves and stun foes.These waves are strong enough to shatter glass windows. Their compound eyes can turn 360°, allowing them to see in virtually any direction. This is useful when Yanma are hunting their preferred prey—insects. Yanma are very territorial against other Yanma, defending their domains from intruders with attacks like Sonic Boom and Bug Buzz.
They primarily reside in humid swamps and marshes, though they can also be found in damper woodlands. Yanma catch insects in their strong mandibles, oftentimes grabbing them out of the air mid-flight and carrying them back to their nests to feed upon in private. They use the two long growths on either end of their tails to remain balanced as they quickly dart around in search of food.
",Clear Wing Pokémon,"bug,flying",3′11″,83.8
wooper,"Similarly to Poliwhirl and Clobbopus, Wooper normally live in the water, though they come out of the water to search for food when evening arrives and the temperature drops. When they come up and walk around on land, they coat their bodies with a slimy, gooey film to keep themselves from drying out- however, the film is also toxic and poisonous, so touching them causes a stinging pain. When they go to sleep, they half-bury themselves in mud at the bottom.
Paldean Wooper once lived in the water during ancient times until they were forced out of their territory. As a result, they gradually adapted to living on land, namely in marshes. Paldean Wooper employs two adaptations to allow it to survive on land: its gills have hardened, and it coats its body with a poisonous film that keeps it from drying out. However, these adaptations resulted in Paldean Wooper having heavy bodies and being only able to move really slowly. To defend itself, Paldean Wooper can use its gills to unleash a powerful poisonous liquid.

quagsire,"A type of carefree Pokémon, Quagsire are usually seen swimming aimlessly and leisurely in the water, though such behavior causes them to hit objects such as rocks and bottom of boats.
Furthermore, Quagsire like round objects and in one particular day of a year, they gather near the water and throw those round objects into streams. According to legends and myths, when a group of people go to the lower banks of streams to search for those objects, the last person to return will have good fortune.
In the anime, wild Quagsire are shown to have an annual celebration at Blue Moon Falls when the moon is full. There they attempt to shoot round objects they have collected to the top of a waterfall with their attacks to see who can launch their objects the highest, with the apparent target being the moon.
",Water Fish Pokémon,"water,ground",4′07″,165.3
espeon,"Espeon are extremely loyal to their trainers.
In popular culture, Espeon are connected with the sun and daylight, likely due to their conditions for evolution. It is said that it gathers psychic energy in its gem through sunbathing, making them poor battlers in the dark of night.
",Sun Pokémon,psychic,2′11″,58.4
umbreon,"Umbreon are carnivorous Pokémon, and will stalk prey silently during the night. When an Umbreon senses an enemy's presence, it waits for its enemy to come into range. It kills its prey by biting it by its throat before eating the corpse. 
Despite being carnivores, they are very protective of their trainers and will chase aggressors with Pursuit.
Umbreon are rarely found in the wild, and are more commonly sighted in urban areas.
",Moonlight Pokémon,dark,3′03″,59.5
murkrow,"Murkrow is considered to be unpopular and are generally viewed as unlucky. Many superstitiously believe that a person will be forever lost in a forest if they follow a Murkrow.
Just like real crows, Murkrow is attracted to shiny objects, and often competes with Meowth and Gible for this reason. They will also give shiny gifts to their Trainers. People who come across either of their stashes will commonly find stolen objects dating back decades. In badlands, they are also known to infiltrate Gabite hoards in search of treasure. Murkrow are often underlings for their evolved form Honchkrow, stealing for their bosses’ hoards. Because they are nocturnal, parents often warn their children to “get home before the Murkrow fly.”
",Darkness Pokémon,"dark,flying",1′08″,4.6
slowking,"Unlike Slowpoke and Slowbro, Slowking is much cleverer and royal. Shellder's bite releases venom into Slowpoke's brain, causing a chemical chain-reaction that unlocks superior intelligence and extraordinary power. More venom is injected into Slowking every time it yawns. The more venom the Shellder releases, the more intelligent Slowking will become. However, if the Shellder on its head comes off, it will forget everything it has learned. Slowking's intelligence can match that of a human and it constantly attempts to learn more. Its inspiration and intuition are also highly developed, and Slowking is able to stay calm in any situation and plan situations with effective results. As seen in PJ026, if the crown were to land on a different creature's head, the new wearer starts to act strangely until the crown is removed.
In the anime, it can understand and speak the human language. According to The Complete Pokémon Pocket Guide, it has such an easy-going personality that it is never stressed. Slowking is rarely found in the wild, though it can be found by the water's edge. It has been seen eating seaweed and drinking coconut milk. In Alola, Slowking occasionally matches wits with Oranguru by the beach.
",Royal Pokémon,"water,psychic",6′07″,175.3
misdreavus,"Misdreavus, whether owned by a Trainer or not, are nocturnal creatures that enjoy pranking humans and other Pokémon for its own amusement, usually giving them jump-scares or eerily screeching in a wailing manner. They may even go as far as pulling and biting a person's hair just to entertain themselves. When their pranks succeed, they cannot help but give out a gloating grin. Nonetheless, they cannot deal with people who are braver and more courageous, so they can get outwitted easily.
Misdreavus normally lurk around in murky forests, caves, graveyards, or abandoned residences. 
",Screech Pokémon,ghost,2′04″,2.2
unown,"Unown rarely leave their home dimension. Together, a large amount of them can produce enough psychic power to reshape reality based on the dreams of whoever summoned them.
",Symbol Pokémon,psychic,1′08″,11
wobbuffet,"Wobbuffet almost never attack foes without provocation. In fact, they prefer to avoid confrontation entirely, sheltering themselves away from most other Pokémon. They hate light and shock, living in dark caves and forests that receive almost no light at all. When Wobbuffet are attacked, they inflate themselves and counter; even so, they won't attack again unless their foes are unwise enough to attack twice. Their unconfrontational natures can have rather humorous side effects. Wobbuffet are territorial Pokémon, but will refuse to attack unless struck first. Thus, when two Wobbuffet meet, they will have a stand-off of sorts, refusing to budge before the other. Such duels quickly become fasting contests. One notable exception to their passiveness is when it comes to defending their tails. They will ferociously attack anyone who threatens them and will go to great lengths to keep them concealed in darkness (such as only leaving their caves at night). It is said these tails hold some sort of deep secret about Wobbuffet.
",Patient Pokémon,psychic,4′03″,62.8
girafarig,"Girafarig's tail has a second brain, however it is not capable of thinking. Rather, it will attack instinctively if approached. As the tail does not need to sleep, it will guard Girafarig while it sleeps. When Girafarig graze on grass and tree shoots, their rear heads mimic the chewing motions the true heads make even though they aren't actually eating anything. Similar behavior can be observed when Girafarig vocalize, spit, yawn, or otherwise use their mouths. Though the rear heads have rudimentary brains, they also have very well-developed senses of smell. They react to particularly alluring scents by lashing out and biting.
",Long Neck Pokémon,"normal,psychic",4′11″,91.5
pineco,"Pineco make their homes under the branches of trees, attaching themselves with a sticky, resinous fluid they produce from their bodies. They also uses this fluid to attach pieces of tree bark to themselves, creating thicker, makeshift shells that protect them from avian Pokémon who mistake them for actual pinecones. Older individuals can construct huge shells this way, with some surrounding themselves with so much bark that the branches supporting them begin to sag or even break. Pineco don’t move much, sticking to the same branch until evolution. They remain sedentary and feed upon unsuspecting insects that land on the bark surrounding them and become trapped in the sticky fluid they secrete. This resin is fragrant, smelling like the pine trees they are often found on. Multiple Pineco can often be found living in a single tree, sometimes even on the same branches. When such trees are disturbed, Pineco are known to drop off of their branches in order to defend their neighbors. They can spontaneously ignite their resin and explode, sending pieces of their bark casings everywhere like shrapnel.
",Bagworm Pokémon,bug,2′00″,15.9
forretress,"Forretress have shells that are steel-hard. Like Pineco, they are largely sessile, living out their lives almost entirely in a single tree. However, while Pineco prefer to live in branches, Forretress makes their homes in the nooks and crannies of tree trunks. They are insectivores, catching bugs that are attracted to the scent of Pineco resin around them. Forretress can no longer produce this resin themselves, however, so they are always found within trees of Pineco colonies. Researchers are baffled by the contents of their shells. Forretress carapaces are impenetrable even by the marvels of modern science. They only crack open just barely wide enough to catch prey, and do it so quickly that the motion is practically invisible to the naked eye. Though Forretress can still explode like Pineco, they prefer to defend themselves with Spikes. Their shells naturally chip from outside weather conditions—by periodically spinning rapidly, they can dislodge sharp, broken pieces of their shells onto the ground below to deter predators from approaching. This maneuver is in fact a defensive reflex that triggers instinctually whenever Forretress are startled.
",Bagworm Pokémon,"bug,steel",3′11″,277.3
dunsparce,"Dunsparce are troglobites, living out their entire lives in pitch-black caves (some populations are confirmed to be trogloxines, sometimes venturing outside their caverns). They are very nearly blind, using the two protrusions on the undersides of their lower jaws to feel their way around in total darkness. When threatened, they will burrow backwards into the earth using their drill-like tails. Dunsparce form very intricate subterranean nests, living in in colonies (called “broods”) numbering in the hundreds.
Predators who are able to follow Dunsparce down their holes as they burrow to escape will be met with near-inescapable mazes of intersecting tunnels; Dunsparce themselves can navigate their labyrinths using their excellent senses of smell. In some regions, they even cohabitate peacefully with Diglett and share their tunnel networks. Dunsparce also have pairs of vestigial wing growths located on their backs. Though they are very weak, Dunsparce can be trained to float a few centimeters off the ground for several seconds by flapping these growths furiously. However, they are unable to actually take off and fly in the air, and are normally left very exhausted by the sheer effort required to even lift slightly off of the ground.
",Land Snake Pokémon,normal,4′11″,30.9
gligar,"Gligar cling to steep cliff sides when resting, digging their pincers and claws into the rocky mountainside to hold on. They travel by gliding on favorable winds; though they can journey very far with this method, they are unable to truly “fly” like most avians, and do not flap their “wings” like them either. Gligar live in colonies of roughly a dozen individuals, all nesting on the same cliff. To hunt, Gligar soar in search of suitable prey, dropping down below when they find some. Then, they stretch out all of their limbs and dive at the faces of their victims. They latch on with their pincers and then use their stingers to inject poison and paralyze prey; then, they carry their meals back to their nests without resistance. 
Trained Gligar are known to use this face-hugging habit as a form of affection with their trainers, sans the digging of claws into the flesh and the injection of poison into their trainers’ foreheads (though there have been some accidents reported).
",Fly Scorpion Pokémon,"ground,flying",3′07″,142.9
steelix,"Steelix are rather rash and often charge into situations without thinking about the consequences of their actions. Often if they are disturbed they will attack anyone rather than the actual person responsible for disturbing them. They also often prone to being a bit vain and in some cases a bully to other Pokémon that happen to live in the area they are living in. This could be from evolving from Onix and realizing how powerful they have become and letting this knowledge go to their heads, as Onix are usually more peaceful than Steelix. Steelix don't give up until they are beaten. Often they are adamant about their choice of action. Steelix like to burrow underground and prefer to live inside mountains or on mountains, or even caves.
",Iron Snake Pokémon,"steel,ground",30′02″,881.8
snubbull,"Despite its rather intimidating appearance, Snubbull has a playful and affectionate personality, similar to the real-life bulldog, which makes it a popular pet among the women of the Pokémon world. Another of Snubbull's personality traits is its cowardice, which it tries to hide behind a gruff exterior.
",Fairy Pokémon,fairy,2′00″,17.2
granbull,"Despite its fierce appearance, it is actually very timid. Unless Granbull is startled, it will not bite indiscriminately. If attacked, it will flail about to fend off its attacker.despite this There is one situation, though, where Granbull will attack ferociously: when their loved ones are threatened. If their offspring, friends, or other that Granbull care for are threatened, they will attack in blind rages against the offenders. This curious aspect of their personalities—docile unless they sense threats—make them great guards within domestic homes. However, they are far less useful when defending properties, as they will avoid conflict if no lives are at stake. Still, their loyalty makes them popular pets.
",Fairy Pokémon,fairy,4′07″,107.4
qwilfish,"To defend themselves, Qwilfish quickly swallow large amounts of water (2.6 gallons/approx. 10 litres on average) and inflate themselves to up to twice their original sizes, hoping to match their foes in stature. In this state, they can launch the spikes off of their bodies to spear and inject enemies with their toxins. While inflated, however, Qwilfish experience much trouble swimming; though they are already not very good swimmers when deflated, they often will fail to move at all when fully inflated, simply floating along in the ocean currents until they expel all of their water. 
Qwilfish are territorial and will engage in inflation contests to see who can grow the largest. Generally, individuals float away in currents before winners can be determined. They usually swim in the open ocean, far away from the shore.
",Balloon Pokémon,"water,poison",1′08″,8.6
scizor,"They are tougher and stronger than Scyther, but have lost their predecessor's speed. Instead, they spread their wings to cool off, and flap them very rapidly to heat up, or to blow air to cool themselves off. While Scyther are mantis-like predator, striking fast and simply evading potential pursuers, Scizor are coated with a red steel of sorts and therefore not quite as agile. Once they engage their foes, either in the wild or at the direction of a Pokémon Trainer in a Pokémon battle, they behave more like Scyther, striking quickly with their powerful claws, raking more than pinching, and relying on their startling agility to evade attacks. They will raise their claws and wave them around to scare off predators or foes, giving them the appearance of having three heads.
Scizor are known to live in the grasslands despite not being found in the wild.
",Pincer Pokémon,"bug,steel",5′11″,260.1
shuckle,"Shuckle live among rocks within cracks and crevices. They secrete a corrosive fluid from their feet that can dissolve holes into boulders, tucking themselves in and withdrawing their limbs for safety in their makeshift shelters.To avoid damage, Shuckle tuck themselves into their shells and remain perfectly still. They subsist on diets of only Berries.When they find Berries, they store some within their shells. They then begin to decompose, ferment, and mix with their own bodily fluids to become a pulpy liquid. Depending on the type of Berries stored, the resulting juice can have a variety of interesting effects. One of the most common is known simply as Berry Juice, replenishing the health of Pokémon who drink it.
",Mold Pokémon,"bug,rock",2′00″,45.2
heracross,"Heracross is a powerful but docile Pokémon. Its natural habitat is forests and its diet consists of tree sap, nectar and honey. Heracross are also shown to work with Butterfree in the wild in order to share sap to eat. Its strength is such that it can topple large trees if it so wished. Heracross's main weapon is its large horn, of which it is particularly proud. However, it only uses it in the wild to deter its foes, not hurt them. Heracross often fight using brute strength, usually pushing pack their foes and lifting them with their arms and horn.
",Single Horn Pokémon,"bug,fighting",4′11″,119
sneasel,"Most Sneasel are cunning, and they usually form small groups to hunt down their prey through ambushing during nighttime, though disputes are often sparked off within them. Some of them may live with Weavile in a group. They are known to steal eggs from unattended nests or even sneak into daycare centers to get some just to suck the eggs' contents, with pairs working to lure the parents away while robbing for eggs. They can also use their retractable and sharp claws to intimidate opponents and tear weak spots of any vulnerable prey. Some may hunt on preys like Sandshrew, but sometimes have their claws being snapped off by Sandshrew's rough skin.
",Sharp Claw Pokémon,"dark,ice",2′11″,61.7
teddiursa,"They are always licking their paws, because there is honey on them at all times. Each individual has its own taste preferences, and will have different ""recipes"" to suit their tastes. As such, no two sets of Teddiursa paws will taste the same. When they find honey in the wild, the crescent marks on their heads will glow. However, they do not immediately eat their found honey, but instead they store it in a variety of different hiding places. This practice helps them keep steady food supplies during cold winters when sustenance is scarce. 
Though Teddiursa don't hibernate like Ursaring, they do become noticeably less active during the winter. In the wild, they will hole up in caves near one of their hidden stashes when the weather turns cold, waiting patiently for spring to arrive.
",Little Bear Pokémon,normal,2′00″,19.4
ursaring,"Ursaring seems to be a rather angry Pokémon, and often attacks people who cross its path or wake it up from slumber. They are very territorial, and mark their territories by scratching claw marks into trees. They in fact defend their domains fiercely, and will not hesitate to maul unwary trespassers. Generally, though, they will leave human travelers alone unless provoked. However, exceptions arise during mating season, when Ursaring become highly aggressive and agitated. They also defend their young very ferociously, so travelers should be cautious of approaching young Teddiursa; their parents may in fact be nearby.
They usually wander fields and mountains to search for Berries when the cold strikes. During this time, their hunger makes them very dangerous to be approached. They prefer to simply snap trees in half and pick up fallen ones from the ground, and to sleep high up in treetops. Ursaring also have keen senses of smell, able to distinguish most scents and find food buried deep underground. Due to them being bears, they are annual hibernators; in the winter, they lie dormant in their dens for months.
",Hibernator Pokémon,normal,5′11″,277.3
slugma,"Thin, transparent skin actually covers the bodies of Slugma. Instead of blood, however, their circulatory systems pump molten-hot lava to transport vital nutrients and minerals throughout their bodies. This lava bubbles out of small pores in their skin, leaving trails of the substance as they move around. Because of this unique system, Slugma can only live for extended periods of time in very warm areas, particularly volcanoes. Should they stop moving in cooler places, the lava within their bodies will begin to harden, become brittle, and crumble. The cooler Slugma are, the slower they will move, until they stop moving altogether. In areas where lava and magma are common, large groups of Slugma, sometimes numbering in the hundreds, can be seen congregating where the lava oozes out. In order to remain healthy, Slugma must dip themselves in lava or magma every so often to replenish the lava lost from traveling. Some Poké Marts sell a lava substitute specifically for Slugma and Magcargo, which is both nontoxic and safe to the touch.
",Lava Pokémon,fire,2′04″,77.2
magcargo,"Though the shells of Magcargo appear to be solid and rock-hard, they are in fact simply thin shells of cooled lava (like skins of sorts); they break at the slightest touch. Luckily, this does not harm Magcargo, as new lava will simply rise to the top and harden into new shells.
Flames periodically spurt from small cracks in their shells; this is their way of disposing of waste, combusting it within their molten shells. Their bodies can reach temperatures of 18,000&#160;°F (10,000&#160;°C), hot enough to vaporize water on contact. When it rains, their mere presence can create thick fog that can blanket areas within seconds.
Like Slugma, Magcargo gradually lose some of their lava and become smaller through simple locomotion as they leave trails. They can return to their original sizes by taking dips in magma pools. Trained Magcargo can also use the lava substitutes sold at some Poké Marts with no ill effects. Magcargo are almost only found in active volcanic craters, leading some scientists to believe that they adapted their molten bodies to cope with their environment.
",Lava Pokémon,"fire,rock",2′07″,121.3
swinub,"Swinub have very keen senses of smell. They are often trained to locate rare mushrooms that only grow underground. In the wild, Swinub use their smell to forage for their favorite food—truffles. Swinub also have a talent for sniffing out concealed hot springs under ice. Though they themselves have little use for such springs, they do enjoy grazing on the plant life that grows around them. Ski resorts and inns often are built near areas with large numbers of Swinub, banking on the hopes that there are hot springs nearby to draw in tourists. Swinub have rather poor vision, relying mostly on their noses to find their way. When they smell something particularly enticing, they will dash quickly towards it, unaware of any obstacles in their way. Their thick coats of long fur keep them warm on the ice, insulating them from the cold. Although their favorite food is mushrooms, they aren't very picky eaters and will consume nearly anything edible that they manage to locate with their noses.
",Pig Pokémon,"ice,ground",1′04″,14.3
piloswine,"Unlike its previous evolutionary stage, Piloswine can be very dangerous if it is spooked or angered.Like Swinub, Piloswine rely largely on their very powerful senses of smell to navigate. However, they also have highly developed senses of hearing. They can sound small grunts or snorts and then listen to the returning echoes to locate objects around them. If they sense disturbances, the hairs on their bodies will stand straight; they will also charge in the direction of the sound. Because of their poor vision, they may continue charging repeatedly in the same course, not noticing when foes have moved for a few seconds. 
Their tusks become harder after fresh snowfalls. Piloswine use these tusks to fend off enemies and dig up food from beneath the frost.
",Swine Pokémon,"ice,ground",3′07″,123
corsola,"Found in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back. It is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town. Corsola's horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving as seen in the anime. Smaller Pokémon like Seadra and Luvdisc are sometimes sheltered by Corsola's branches, and even offer it protection from foes.
Galarian Corsola were wiped out by sudden changes in ocean temperature caused by a meteor impact, turning them into Ghost-types. Their branches can be used to take root inside and drain the life force of others, leaving any opponent petrified as a result. While they can be mistaken for ordinary rocks, they will curse anybody who kicks them by accident, and it's said that they sometimes attack humans and Pokémon that they come in contact with. 
In Alola, Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola. However, they do not fulfill those roles in Galar, possibly with Corsola being a Ghost type Pokémon in Galar due to being wiped out by climate change in ocean temperature after a meteorite impact. 
",Coral Pokémon,"water,rock",2′00″,11
remoraid,"Remoraid begin their lives in the sea. Upon hatching, they are largely unable to find hunt on their own. Instead, they use the suction pad-like fins on their heads to attach to the undersides of Mantine. There, they can consume scraps that drift past them while the Mantine are feeding. They will also defend the Mantine when they are endangered in order to keep their hosts safe.
Once they are old enough to find food for themselves, they travel into freshwater rivers. Remoraid hunt by hiding just beneath the river's surface and shooting out bullets of water at unsuspecting insects above. They can shoot up to 300 feet (91 m) away with amazing accuracy, even at moving targets. To do this, Remoraid squeeze their abdominal muscles to expel small pellets of water from their mouth. They also use this trick to escape from foes, propelling themselves backwards with the recoil. These “shots” even work underwater, striking foes from crevices on the riverbed or sea floor.
As evolution approaches, Remoraid will swim downstream in large numbers back into the ocean, where they will stay for the rest of their lives. In Alola, the Remoraid population is fact entirely maritime, breeding and developing solely in the ocean; there, they are known as the ""snipers of the sea"".
Part of their diet, as seen in variants from Hisui, are Burmy, which they shoot down from dangling branches.
",Jet Pokémon,water,2′00″,26.5
octillery,"Octillery mostly makes its home within holes and other underwater crevasses. It attacks its foes with ink that can blind them which doubles as a defensive tactic to deter predators. In addition, Octillery will use its tentacles to latch onto foes before knocking them out with a strong headbutt. The ink that Octillery sprays has been coveted in the Alola region as a cooking ingredient.
",Jet Pokémon,water,2′11″,62.8
delibird,"Delibird is omnivorous. It carries food bundled up in its tail. It normally gives stored food to its chicks, but has been known to share its food with humans stranded on icy mountains. In a flock, the Delibird with the largest tail is its leader. Delibird tends to live in&#160;mountainous regions, making its nests over sharp cliffs; one notable area of the world is around Mt. Everest.Male and female Delibird mate for life. While females stay with their young to keep watch, males spend the day looking for food, which they roll up and store within their sack-like tails to bring home.Delibird are also curious Pokémon; besides food, they also collect pretty, strange, and sometimes even dangerous objects within their tails.Their generous reputations have made them symbols of various holidays centered around gift-giving.When threatened, Delibird defend themselves by using Present, chucking the contents of their tails at attackers. Projectiles include food, rocks, and even explosives—whatever Delibird have found on their travels.

skarmory,"Skarmory make their nests in bramble bushes. Though born with soft skin, they quickly callous and harden through the constant scratching of their prickly nests.Skarmory are highly aggressive and territorial, engaging in vicious battles over disputed land. They will rip off wings and feathers from foes with their sharp beaks or talons to send them plummeting to the ground. In Galar, they compete with Corviknight for territory. Skarmory are known to kidnap small, defenseless Pokémon from their trainers or parents in hopes of luring larger prey seeking to retrieve them back to their nests. They have even been observed tearing off the limbs of weaker creatures or chasing them off cliffs simply for fun. Because their water can rust their wings, Skarmory seek shelter in brambles during the rain.
Skarmory are used by the faculty and students in Blueberry Academy as Flying Taxis.
",Armor Bird Pokémon,"steel,flying",5′07″,111.3
houndour,"Houndour live in packs and communicate in barks. They are nocturnal predators. They are extremely loyal to each other; if one member of a pack is attacked, the others will gang up on the foe. Packs of Houndour each develop their own unique sets of calls. When hunting, they use these calls to alert each other of their locations. Then, they work together to corner their prey; they have demonstrated to be intelligent enough to form complex, unique strategies for catching prey depending on their surroundings and the skills of their quarry. 
In fact, Houndour demonstrate some of the most efficient teamwork in the Pokémon world. Around dawn, packs will howl ominously at the moon to indicate to other nearby packs of the boundaries of their territories. Unlike most pack hunters, Houndour packs have no true leaders. Rather, they all are equals and split responsibilities fairly; thus, there is never any infighting for dominance. Houndour are very affectionate towards those they care about; generally, this means other pack members, but for domestic ones this can mean their Trainers as well.
",Dark Pokémon,"dark,fire",2′00″,23.8
houndoom,"Wild Houndoom usually fight for leadership, with the ones that have sharply raked horns having the leading advantage. According to some old sayings, the flare of Houndoom contains toxins and the wound caused by a Houndoom can never be healed or recover. Because of their horrifying cry that sounds like the death from Hell, people and Pokémon in ancient times mostly stay in their homes when they hear Houndoom's howl. Houndoom packs hunt by encircling an area and then setting it ablaze. They then go after prey flushed out of hiding, working together to corner and defeat them. Like Houndour, Houndoom packs share their kills evenly; the leader receives the same portion as the lowliest pack member. 
",Dark Pokémon,"dark,fire",4′07″,77.2
kingdra,"It is said that Kingdra lives and sleeps at the bottom of the sea floor, at extreme depths that are otherwise devoid of life due to water pressure. It also usually hides in underwater caves. It is believed to create maelstroms by yawning. When a storm arrives, it is said to awaken and wander about in search of prey. When it comes to the surface, it creates a huge whirlpool with enough force to swallow ships.
Kingdra will appear on land whenever a storm is whipped up at sea. Once it crosses paths with Dragonite, a fierce battle ensues. The scales that Kingdra shed give off a brilliant gleam and are often given to royalty as gifts. 
",Dragon Pokémon,"water,dragon",5′11″,335.1
phanpy,"Phanpy nests, essentially vertical dirt pits with a shallow edge to climb out of, can be found near rivers and waterholes. They will mark surrounding trees with their trunks to signal that these areas have been claimed. In the early morning, Phanpy can be seen showering together in rivers, using their snouts as nozzles. They dry themselves off in the sun over the course of the day. Phanpy are very affectionate and playful Pokémon. Though small, they are strong enough to carry adult humans on their backs. They will often “play” with their trainers by charging into them, but the force of ​their impacts can be enough to send their trainers flying. Alternatively, they will knock things around with their trunk for fun; this pastime generally can be very destructive to the personal belongings of humans. They can easily lift over 150&#160;lbs (68&#160;kg) with their trunks and can also toss objects of similar weights dozens of yards away. Consequently, these affectionate Pokémon can also be very dangerous to be around as well.
",Long Nose Pokémon,ground,1′08″,73.9
donphan,"Donphan's behavior was mostly seen in the anime. It likes to use moves like Rollout. As a form of attacking, becoming impossible to stop and able to demolish houses, as well as by males to establish dominance.The male Donphan have rolling competitions to demonstrate their toughness to the females. It has been demonstrated that Donphan has a keen sense of smell, capable of sniffing out a gem known as amberite. Donphan travels in herds with a ranking system. The larger its tusks, the higher its rank in the herd.
",Armor Pokémon,ground,3′07″,264.6

",Virtual Pokémon,normal,2′00″,71.7
stantler,"They live together in herds and dwell in forests. As shown in the anime, a baby Stantler that is separated from its herd and frightened will instinctively produce an illusion of a big, stampeding herd to scare away perceived threats. It can be presumed that Stantler shed their horns at some point.
Spooked Stantler herds will actually stampede, and it does not take much to scare these restless creatures.These Pokémon herd by nature, so it can be difficult to raise a single one. Young Stantler are particularly skittish if separated from their herds, while older ones are less easily scared. They will become more docile and calm once they get used to their surroundings.
Stantler herds graze on grasses and shrubs, traveling from one area to the next as they search for food. In more barren areas, such as mountains, they may also scrape off mosses and lichens from rocks for sustenance.

smeargle,"Smeargle live alone, but do maintain groups of “comrades”; comrade Smeargle will pass through each other's territories, share details of food source locations with each other, and even paint each other's bodies for fun. Their tails secrete a colorful, viscous fluid that they uses to paint trees, marking their domains in this manner. Different Smeargle have “paint” of different colors; the hue is determined by a variety of factors, including genetics, diet, and environment. Recent studies have shown that the intensity of their ""paint"" color changes based on their emotions. Smeargle born around the same time in the same area will become comrades with one another. These groups remain close for life, though they will separate and claim their own territories upon reaching adulthood. Before Smeargle leave their groups, their comrades will paint footprint markings on their backs; if they ever meet again, they will be able to distinguish each other by the pattern. Smeargle can paint over 5,000 different kinds of brush strokes with their tails. They are the only Pokémon known to learn the move Sketch. Wild Smeargle paintings are a fairly esoteric market, but enthusiasts will pay quite hefty sums of money for certain symbols and patterns.
",Painter Pokémon,normal,3′11″,127.9
tyrogue,"Tyrogue are a wandering Pokémon, having no fixed shelter and constantly moving to different locations. They are very determined and energetic, spending the day searching for new foes to spar with. They will attempt to engage in combat with nearly anything that moves, but will not attack unless they believe the opponent has given consent. Tyrogue accept victory humbly, but will sometimes take losses less than graciously. If defeated, they will nurse their wounds until healed, but will then immediately search for the foe that defeated them and attempt to hold a rematch. They will continue to do so until they become strong enough to win. 
Tyrogue will fight until exhaustion, even when it is clear that they will lose. They take their training very seriously, and will become stressed if they miss even a single day. As a result, trainers with Tyrogue must maintain consistent and varied training regimens to keep their Tyrogue healthy. Despite their size, they are strong fighters; opponents will often be surprised by their skill in combat.
",Scuffle Pokémon,fighting,2′04″,46.3
hitmontop,"Hitmontop are rather unorthodox fighters, as one may notice from their upside-down orientation in combat. When fighting, they perform enchanting “dances” of sorts before turning on their heads and spinning. Foes that are entranced by their elegant motions are then caught off-guard by their sudden flips, being pummeled by flurry of kicks as Hitmontop use Triple Kick. This spinning motion is both an offensive and defensive tactic; on one hand, their centrifugal force increases the strength of their hits by a factor of 10. On the other, their rapid spinning enables them to deflect many projectiles aimed at them. Hitmontop actually travel faster by spinning than walking. If they spin fast enough, they may even begin to drill holes into the ground. Hitmontop can be found in dojos teaching others the art of balance, which is important in many forms of martial arts. Even when pushed, they can orient themselves so that they tilt back into equilibrium without being acted upon by another external force.
",Handstand Pokémon,fighting,4′07″,105.8
smoochum,"To onlookers, Smoochum would appear to be rather vain Pokémon; they constantly check their reflections in ice or water to see if their faces have gotten dirty and will spend copious amounts of time cleaning themselves if they have; they do not seem to care nearly as much about bodily hygiene. 
However, keeping clean is important to Smoochum because their skin is very sensitive; even mild irritants such as stray dirt can cause them to break out in rashes. Their lips are particularly delicate; they use them as their main method of gathering information about their surroundings. When they come across something foreign, their first instinct is to run up to it (though they are rather clumsy and often fall) and kiss it. This is also how it cleans objects prior to touching them, smooching them and then licking the dirt off of its lips. Smoochum can distinguish and remember thousands of different objects based on their textures and taste from their lips alone. They then categorize these things into what they like and dislike. 
As they walk, they bob their heads back and forth constantly, as if they are about to kiss someone. They dislike heat and will become cranky and irritable when feeling uncomfortably warm. In the wild, Smoochum keep their lips moisturized by applying tree sap.

elekid,"Elekid tends to become restless and full-on rowdy when it hears the sound of thunderstorm coming, and likes to play out in the middle of thunderstorms. It can generate electricity by rotating its arms, but it tires easily and can only charge a small amount. Elekid cannot store the electricity it generates, so it prefers to break into the houses of humans in order to consume electricity from their electrical outlets.

magby,"Its body temperature and the fire that it breathes are constantly over 1100 degrees F.

blissey,"Blissey are some of the most compassionate Pokémon in the world. Their fur twitches when they sense beings that are sad or ill, and they immediately try to make them feel better. They can sense unhappiness from over a mile away. Blissey will often share their eggs with complete strangers who happen to be down on their luck. A single bite of their eggs, which have enough vitamins and minerals to feed a person for a whole day, can immediately lift spirits and ease illnesses. Consuming whole eggs will compel people or Pokémon to act just as kindly as Blissey to others until the nutrients from the eggs pass through their systems. If Blissey is in a loving environment it is capable of producing a single egg a day. Unsurprisingly, ethically sourced eggs are a huge delicacy due to their rarity and are exorbitantly expensive. 
Because of their compassionate natures, Blissey are often found working in Pokémon Centers alongside their pre-evolutions Chansey; in fact, they are more commonly found in Centers than in the wild, where they are exceedingly rare (even more so than the already-elusive Chansey). Blissey will work tirelessly to heal the sick and weary, not being able to rest until their patients are at the very least in stable conditions.

In the Pokédex, it states that it&#160;""descends with the lightning"", and it ""races across the land barking a cry that sounds like crashing thunder"". While running, it stores up static electricity, then shoots off the excess. It is also said to help other Electric Pokémon if they are in danger.

They frequently seek other Pokémon worthy of their time to fight. Tyranitar that live in Galar are known to frequently clash with Duraludon over resources and territory. Despite those traits they are affectionate to their own and those who took care of it; some as a Larvitar, others as an an adult tyranitar.
Mega Tyranitar's drastic evolution has caused some people to wonder if it even listens to its Trainer's orders.

lugia,"Known as the Guardian of the Seas, Lugia is tremendously intelligent and is very gentle with the life around it, despite its colossal size. Due to the fact that it can blow houses away with the single flap of its wings, it isolates itself deep within the great current, to prevent it from harming civilization. Lugia is also intelligent enough to even speak telepathically, like Mewtwo. It can gracefully fly through the skies and sometimes resembles a bird. It is closely related to Ho-Oh, which is considered to be its rival or polar opposite, as Ho-Oh is the Guardian of the Skies. The two once both resided in Ecruteak City atop the Tin and Brass Towers and were worshiped by humans until the Brass Tower burnt to the ground and both flew away. Lugia and Ho-Oh are the mascots of Pokémon Gold and Silver, as well as the remakes HeartGold and SoulSilver. Strangely, the two Pokémon have completely different types. Fire and Psychic is a very unusual match up, this is also strange because Lugia knows Water-type attacks, giving Ho-Oh the disadvantage in battle. This may be a reason that these Pokémon have never battled each other in the anime. It is also known that if Lugia flaps its wings, it causes a 40-day storm.
It is highly intelligent, and because of the devastating power it could accidentally inflict, it isolates itself deep underwater and tends to sleep in solitude. Lugia is the&#160;only known Pokémon&#160;that learns&#160;Aeroblast. It is extremely&#160;rare&#160;and is hardly ever seen.

Treecko never panic, even when faced with stronger foes, and will stand their ground no matter what. Though rare in the wild, they can be occasionally found high up in the branches of tall trees. They make their nests there to stay away from most predators. When their trees are threatened, Treecko will leap down and ferociously defend their homes.Treecko are known to stare down foes much larger themselves and provoke them into combat; however, they will never back down from a fight. Their unwavering collectedness and tenacity make them popular choices for First partner Pokémon.

grovyle,"Grovyle are masters of climbing. Upon evolution, however, they also gain the skills of jumping and leaping as well. In the dense forests in which they reside, Grovyle can leap from tree branch to tree branch with ease, gliding between them using the leaves on their arms for aid. This ability enables them to both escape from predators and sneak up on prey. Grovyle have extremely powerful thigh muscles that allow them to perform such jumping feats. In addition to helping them in the air, their foliage also helps them camouflage in the trees. The long leaves on their heads are also sensitive to flowing air currents, allowing them to adjust their trajectories in the air to land exactly where they want to. They are so skilled at jumping, in fact, that some say nothing can catch a fleeing Grovyle in its natural forest habitat. When threatened, Grovyle first confound their foes by swiftly leaping from tree to tree, obscuring their true locations. Then, they suddenly pounce at their opponents, slashing at them with the quick, but strong Leaf Blade.

sceptile,"Sceptile are incredibly swift hunters living in forests. They use their bladed leaves to strike down prey and battle foes. They also care deeply about the plants and trees in the forests they inhabit, and raise them with loving care. Being reptile, they are cold-blooded, and must regulate their body temperature by basking in the sunlight.Not only are Sceptile protective and nurturing Pokémon, but also fierce and strong ones as well, making them popular starters for trainers in the Hoenn region.
",Forest Pokémon,grass,5′07″,115.1
torchic,"Torchic are very loyal and dependent on its Trainer, following behind them everywhere they would go. They are also afraid of the dark, and will begin crying if left alone at night. Many trainers find their behavior cute, however, and thus choose Torchic as their First partner Pokémon in Hoenn.Trainers who have raised Torchic describe embracing them as “like hugging fluffy bottles of hot water;” luckily for Torchic, who are often afraid of sleeping alone, their likeness to warm stuffed plushies also means that most trainers have little problem sleeping alongside them. Their cuteness and quirkiness make them consistently popular choices as First partner Pokémon in Hoenn.
",Chick Pokémon,fire,1′04″,5.5
combusken,"Combusken have very distinctive, harsh cries that are well known to many rural inhabitants. This is due to their training habits; early in the morning, Combusken will go running through plains and mountains to strengthen their legs and thighs. Then, they prepare for kicking practice by letting out loud yells to gain focus. These cries often wake people and Pokémon in the early hours in the morning, much to their dismay. However, their dedication and practice pays off.

blaziken,"The stronger Blazikens' foes are, the more determined Blaziken are to defeat them. Every few years, their feathers burn off from repeated exposure to fire. However, newer, softer ones regrow in their place. These feathers are important because they help Blaziken regulate their body temperatures; when they burn up, they must rest and refrain from using their fire powers until they regrow. Their awesome power and speed make Blaziken strong choices for First partner Pokémon in Hoenn.
",Blaze Pokémon,"fire,fighting",6′03″,114.6
mudkip,"When sleeping, they bury themselves within the soil at the edge of the water. Mudkip and members of its evolution family dwell in swamps or other wetlands, deep inside isolated islands, due to their dislike of freshwater lakes and ponds. They spend roughly equal time on land and in the water, but must keep their skin moist so they don't dry out and become lethargic. They love to play around; many trainers in Hoenn choose Mudkip as their starters because of their uncanny ability to earn the affection of those around them.
",Mud Fish Pokémon,water,1′04″,16.8
marshtomp,"Marshtomp can often be found in muddy estuaries, both near the sea as well as inland. They spend much of their time out of the water; a sticky, mucus-like film coating their skin keeps them moist and prevents air from drying them out. To rehydrate, Marshtomp will play in the mud. Curiously enough, they can actually use their powerful hind legs to travel faster through mud than through clean water. Marshtomp burrow in the mud to sleep. Individuals who live near the ocean sometimes emerge at low tide to play on the beach, while those inland may splash around at the water's edge. Scientists believe that living in soft mud with poor footing is what pressured them to develop such strong hind legs, enabling them to stand firm even in the muck.

It has keen eyesight, enabling it to see in murky waters. Swampert also has the ability to predict storms, sensing subtle differences in the sounds of waves and tidal winds with its fins. When a storm is approaching, Swampert will pile up boulders to protect its nest. It makes its nests on beautiful beaches. The reason Swampert covers itself in mud is that it wants to keep its skin moist. waters. Though strong and aggressive at times, Swampert can still be just as playful as their pre-evolutions; indeed, it is this combination of traits that makes them such popular First partner Pokémon.
",Mud Fish Pokémon,"water,ground",4′11″,180.6
poochyena,"Poochyena is an aggressive Pokémon that will bite at anything that moves. It is tenacious and persistent. It intimidates its enemies by bristling its fur and will relentlessly chase its prey until the victim becomes exhausted. But if its prey strikes back, it will display cowardice by running away.. Running from aggressive Poochyena will only encourage them to begin chasing. Instead, attempting to intimidate them by staring them down and feigning lunges is a far more effective tactic. As the saying goes, they are “all bark and no bite.” They will cower and flee when confronted, even when against smaller or weaker foes. Though Poochyena bare their large fangs against all attackers, they will only pursue things that they believe they have scared. They will become submissive towards those who appear unfazed by their displays, often running away with their tail between their legs.

They travel in packs of about ten members in the wild. It will only obey a trainer that it recognizes to be superior in skill; if it has this powerful trust with its trainer, it will never disobey.Mightyena will flatten their bodies and emit low, guttural growls. These sounds will alert nearby pack members of disturbances, signaling for them to prepare for attack as well. Mightyena packs have very well-defined pecking orders; alpha Mightyena lead their packs and eat first after taking down prey, while the omegas always trail at the end and eat whatever is left over after all the others have finished eating.This mentality carries on to even trained Mightyena.

They rub their bristly back hair against trees to mark their individual territories, and they play dead to fool their opponents in battle as a means to fend themselves from predators.
Galarian Zigzagoon are more provocative, restless and fierce, never wanting to settle down. Having a strong adaptability, they lurk in different residences, ranging from rural to urban areas. They always prefer charging at people and other Pokémon just to provoke a fight, but this strategy is futile outside battles, since most humans tend to mistake their provocation as affection, much to their frustration.
",Tiny Raccoon Pokémon,normal,1′04″,38.6
linoone,"For some reason, Linoone have a fondness for round objects which they will carry in their cheek pouches until they find a suitable place to stash it. They rely primarily on surprise to capture prey, however; though they are indeed fast, their inability to turn makes it easy for targets to escape should they notice Linoone before being attacked. Linoone are also surprisingly adept swimmers, capable of leaping into the water mid-charge to capture aquatic prey.
Galarian Linoone are more rash and fearless, being reckless fighters who pick opponents stronger than themselves and tend to bash right away. Their recklessness has made them exceedingly popular pets among Galarian teens who have nowhere to vent their pent-up anger. Galarian Linoone are also troublemakers that are quick to start fights.They taunt enemies much stronger than themselves by sticking out their tongues and making obscene gestures with their claws. Should these incendiary tactics fail, Galarian Linoone may also charge at targets in games of chicken in order to enrage them. In battle, Galarian Linoone will rush headfirst at opponents at speeds of up to 60 mph (97 km/h) to deliver powerful tackles. They launch themselves with enough force to knock over cars, but their recklessness means that they may also throw themselves off balance if they miss.

They spend most of their time on trees.Wurmple are voracious eaters, as they need to store a good deal of energy for evolution. It is believed that a Wurmple's personality is the primary determining factor in its evolutionary path. Outgoing, cheerful Wurmple tend to evolve into Silcoon, while introverted, downcast ones seem to evolve into Cascoon.

It is also a pollinator and is attracted to all sorts of flowers.They fiercely attack Combee who compete with them for food. During mating season, Beautifly of both genders will attack members of the same sex ruthlessly in competition for mates. They are solitary and territorial Pokémon, only coming together during the spring mating season. During this time, Beautifly attacks also become more common, as the Pokémon both become more aggressive and numerous when mating, riding the spring winds into densely-populated areas.

dustox,"Dustox are nocturnal Pokémon, feeding on the leaves of trees after the sun sets. They use their antennae like radars to navigate without light, though their eyes are in fact quite adept at seeing in the dark. When Dustox flap their wings, they let loose clouds of fine, toxic powder strong enough to make pro wrestlers sick. They uses this in their defense, flapping and letting loose the dust to deter enemies. 
Dustox are attracted to bright lights, a problem for many urban areas; they will often congregate along boulevards and avenues, attracted there by street lamps and large trees. In their wake, Dustox swarms leave behind lines of barren branches and large clouds of toxic powder. Though they will consume nearly any variety of leaves (even some toxic ones, which may have to do with their Poison-typings), Dustox have shown a particular affinity for the leaves of Persim trees, even sometimes feeding on the Berries themselves. This makes them a huge problem for Persim Berry farmers, who consider Dustox the primary pests of the business.

When on dry land, Lotad scuttles towards other ponds because its leaf is too heavy to support, in contrast to Lotad's ancient ancestors which were one primarily land-dwelling Pokémon.Lotad will occasionally leave the water to search for new ponds if their original ones become polluted; they must drink clean water routinely to prevent their pads from wilting. Lotad camouflage themselves underwater, leaving only their leaves exposed to blend in with lily pads. These leaves are buoyant enough to suspend them perfectly in this fashion.Lotad are docile and easygoing Pokémon.

Watching them do this uplifts the spirits of all who see them and encourage them to dance as well. When Ludicolo dance, their cells work much harder than they normally do, producing more energy and making them stronger.
When there isn't music, Ludicolo will seek to create their own rhythms, employing a variety of materials found in their habitats. Tools ranging from stone “drums” to reed pipes have been found near ponds where Ludicolo dwell. In battle, they will play these instruments and dance to the melodies produced in order to power up their attacks. 
Oftentimes, the sight of dancing Ludicolo is enough to placate aggressors, who may even begin dancing as well. They tend to congregate near sources of joyful music; young children hiking near pounds sometimes attract groups of Ludicolo when singing songs. The dancing attracts more Ludicolo until all individuals in the general vicinity are present.

Using the leaves on their heads as flutes, they can play deeply unsettling melodies that fill the hearts of listeners with dread. Alternatively, they may play melodies to put unwary travelers to sleep and then pull off all sorts of tricks on them, such as stealing their supplies. They can also emit disturbing cackling sounds that seem to echo throughout the forest.
Nuzleaf are adept climbers, swiftly leaping between trees to unsettle travelers with the sound of rustling leaves around them. In battle, this uncanny ability to cause dread manifests in the form of the attack Extrasensory.
Nuzleaf have a weak point in the form of their long noses; if they are pinched, Nuzleaf inexplicably become unable to attack. Trainers can also stave them off with open flames.

These updrafts can take Wingull fairly high in the sky. They are clumsy when it comes to flapping, so they usually glide instead. Their beaks are adept at catching fish near the water's surface, though they can also dive if necessary. Wingull have a habit of bringing back food and objects they find and hiding them near their nests. This behavior increases as winter approaches, when they begin storing more food than they eat. Scientists are not sure why Wingull do this, as they do not migrate or hibernate and continue searching for food during the winter despite already having hoards. Some have hypothesized that the storages are intended to attract mates, who use the stashes to gauge how well their creators can catch food. When Wingull rest, they fold their wings inwards, forming “M” shapes. When Wingull flock in the sky, fishermen know many fish lurk below.

In the past, people used Pelipper to send messages overseas; sailors still utilize them today to relay information, especially in areas where other forms of communication aren't available (in this case, the middle of the ocean). Pelipper will carry small Pokémon and items across the sea in exchange for food.

They feed primarily on rotting plant matter and particularly prefer damp soil and compost. After it rains, large numbers of them can be seen emerging from their shelters to feed on the wet, decaying plant matter on the forest floor. Though they normally have mild personalities, Shroomish will not hesitate to attack foes with Poison Powder of Spore if threatened. By shaking their bodies, they can release poisonous spores from the top of their heads, dispersing them in noxious clouds. Inhaling these spores can cause dizziness, nausea, and numbing pain all around the body. Areas with sizable Shroomish populations often will have signs detailing how to avoid startling wild individuals and how to treat Shroomish poisoning.

Generally, Slakoth never change the locations of their nests until they evolve. However, they have been known to travel surprisingly great distances by floating down rivers on logs. Their hearts beat only once a minute, even when potentially in danger. Curiously, despite appearing like sitting ducks, wild Slakoth are rarely ever attacked. Those who see Slakoth loafing around begin to feel drowsy themselves, losing the willpower to attack them.
Slakoth live in large groups numbering over a hundred. Such troops are protected by troops of Vigoroth and are centered around a single Slaking.
",Slacker Pokémon,normal,2′07″,52.9
vigoroth,"They can't sit still for a single second; ceasing movement will stress them out greatly and make them ill. Vigoroth feel a constant urge to go on rampages thanks to their boundless energy. Consequently, they also feel a never-ending desire for food; even when eating, however, they keep moving. In fact, Vigoroth don't sleep, instead spending all of their time running about aimlessly. As they run, they will spin and flail their arms about wildly to burn off more energy, destroying much of what is in their way. 
Vigoroth are territorial beings that live in groups. They defend their Slaking colonies in troops, putting their endless energy to use. They chase off intruders from their colonies in large numbers; oftentimes, up to a dozen Vigoroth will pursue single threats until sufficiently far away. Vigoroth are also in charge of foraging. They gather large amounts of food to bring back home, eating constantly as they travel. Whatever they don't finish eating is piled up at the center of their nests, where their brethren can then feast.
",Wild Monkey Pokémon,normal,4′07″,102.5
slaking,"During most of the day, Slaking lolls around and sleeps. It is considered the laziest Pokémon, but even when it is lounging it's actually saving energy. In truth, it can exert a lot of power by releasing the built-up energy all at once, and can regain lost energy through the use of its former&#160;signature move,&#160;Slack Off. It only moves around when there is no more food within reach for it to eat.
Slaking lives in&#160;forest, and mostly feeds on grass and ripened fruit that falls from trees.
",Lazy Pokémon,normal,6′07″,287.7
nincada,"The claws are used to carve the roots of tree and absorb moisture and nutrients. Nincada builds underground nests at the&#160;roots of trees.&#160;It does not like sunlight, so it avoids it.They can spend as long as 10 years underground, making their nests between the thick roots of large trees so they do not have to travel far to find food. Nincada will use their claws to dig out tunnels connecting their nests to other important areas: water sources, other trees, and exit tunnels to the surface should their nests flood from rain. Nincada need to molt their exoskeletons to continue growing. When molting, they will travel up their exit tunnels onto the trunks of the trees they are nesting in. They do this at night, after the sun has gone down. When they near evolution, they molt for a final time, but do not return to their nests afterwards.
",Trainee Pokémon,"bug,ground",1′08″,12.1
ninjask,"Oftentimes, the only way one can tell that Ninjask are nearby is by the high-pitched buzzing sound they make while flying and the gusts of wind felt by their passing. Ninjask are notoriously difficult to train, refusing orders and emitting their incessantly loud buzzing to annoy their trainers. It is said that trainers must prove their worth to their Ninjask through demonstrations of physical strength, agility, and dexterity in order for them to be deemed worthy of obedience. Listening to their buzzing for extended periods of time can cause headaches, adding to the difficulty of training them. However, those who earn their respect are rewarded with Pokémon so quick that they can dodge virtually any attack through the sheer virtue of their agility. Their favorite food is tree sap; Ninjask can be seen congregating around exposed sap on tree bark, one of the only times they can be seen remaining still.
",Ninja Pokémon,"bug,flying",2′07″,26.5
shedinja,"Shedinja is an evolutionary byproduct of Nincada's evolution; the discarded husk. This Pokémon is said to have originated from a discarded bug shell, which then came to life. Peering into the crack on its back is said to steal one's spirit.They never move or twitch, and don't show any sign of breathing. However, they float perfectly still, in mid-air, despite only appearing to be hollow carapaces.

",Whisper Pokémon,normal,2′00″,35.9
loudred,"Unlike its pre-evolution, it doesn't seem to be timid anymore.During the mating season, Loudred can be seen engaging in shouting matches with each other in competition for mates. Dueling Loudred deafen each other quickly, but will continue yelling without actually knowing who is louder. Competitions end not when one Loudred is deemed the loudest, but rather when the others simply tire and walk away. Such matches can potentially last for days until the Loudred grow hoarse from shouting.
",Big Voice Pokémon,normal,3′03″,89.3
exploud,"Most expect Exploud to be even louder. However, Exploud are able to control the volume of their voices with ease. Outside of battle, they are no louder than other Pokémon, choosing to communicate with whistles of different volumes and pitches from the various sound-producing organs on their bodies. They were once used to send messages between distant towns because of this. In battle, however, they reveals their true sonic capabilities.Notably, Exploud are popular Pokémon in orchestras and bands. This is because they can imitate virtually any wind instrument using their assembly of pipes and can control their pitch and volume without the need for tuning. Some musicians have also experimented with their “singing,” though this testing hasn't gone nearly as smoothly. 
",Loud Noise Pokémon,normal,4′11″,185.2
makuhita,"Makuhita live and train in groups. They have a habit of slapping trees and slamming their bodies into random things. Additionally, Makuhita are determined Pokémon; they will fight until their bodies give in. Even then, they strive to become strong enough to defeat those that had beaten them. In fact, Makuhita learn from their errors; each time they fall, they store energy for evolution and get right back up. They prize their might and work hard to maintain it. They make sure to keep balanced diets with enough calories to for their training and always gets enough sleep to be well-rested.
Though native to Hoenn, Makuhita have been imported to Alola, where they are celebrated for their purportedly superior strength. Makuhita trainers in the region have developed secret recipes for stews purported to maximize the strength and endurance of their Makuhita. Humorously enough, it is not uncommon in Alola to see Makuhita training their palms on trees and then get flung away after accidentally striking an Alolan Exeggutor. 
",Guts Pokémon,fighting,3′03″,190.5
hariyama,"It likes to match power with other big-bodied Pokémon, and can stomp the ground to build its own power. Trucks can be sent flying, telephone poles broken in two, and trains can even be stopped by its powerful arms.They are known to stand on train tracks and stop freight trains with their bare hands simply for fun. Hariyama make liberal use of the moves Arm Thrust and Force Palm. In particular, Hariyama take advantage of the latter’s tendency to paralyze foes. They will combo Force Palm with Smelling Salts, a move that is especially effective on paralyzed enemies. By clapping their two hands together around the heads of foes, Hariyama can easily disorient their opponents and leave them wide open to future attacks. 
Though most famous for their size and bulk, smaller Hariyama can be just as effective fighters by relying more heavily on speed and agility. Older Hariyama retain their immense strength, but prefer to train young Makuhita instead of showing off. These Pokémon have strong senses of etiquette, both in and out of combat, and will congratulate their opponents for a battle well-fought regardless of the outcome. 
They commonly live in mountainous areas.
",Arm Thrust Pokémon,fighting,7′07″,559.5
azurill,"The ball is bouncy and packed with the nutrients it needs to be able to grow. The ball can also be used as a flotation device. It can be seen bouncing and playing on this rubbery tail. The tail can also be spun around like a lasso. When the tail is thrown, the body can go as far as 33 feet (10 meters). Though Azurill is typically docile, it swings the big ball on its tail to smash into opponents bigger than itself when angered.
",Polka Dot Pokémon,"normal,fairy",0′08″,4.4
nosepass,"Their magnetic noses make it so they are always facing north. In rocky areas, they are often seen standing still, only moving about 3/8 of an inch every year. If it gets stuck while turning and moving, it will spin and drill down underground. They can be seen as carnivorous due to their tendencies to pull prey forwards with magnetism, but sometimes, they occasionally pull forward pieces of metal and steel. Two Nosepass cannot approach each other headfirst, because their noses will repel each other away. Curiously, the strength of their magnetism seems to correlate with temperature, weakening in warm weather but strengthening on cooler days.

delcatty,"The catlike Delcatty is known not to be as remarkably cute and playful as its earlier state, but is very prim, fancy, and even somewhat vain. Yet, it is still very kind and can become very close to its own Trainer.
In the wild, the majority of Delcatty like to go on their own way and enjoy freedom. As most Delcatty are nocturnal, they only appear during evenings or nights.
",Prim Pokémon,normal,3′07″,71.9
sableye,"An old story was told that if you look at Sableye while their eyes burn with a sinister glow, your soul will be stolen. However, evidence suggests that this Pokémon is actually very friendly, and they will only do mischief to travelers to win their attention. Their mischief makes them notorious, but in fact it is only because they stay in the caves for too long and eventually become lonely as a result. 
Nonetheless, Sableye in Kalos and Alola are known to stalk Carbink in order to chew the gemstones off of them, but said food is often taken by Gabite before they could grab it. Notoriously, it has a natural rivalry with Mawile in most regions.
Sableye dig holes in cave walls and floors in search of gems and ore, which they crush with their razor-sharp teeth before eating.&#160;Minerals in the ore they eat crystallize on the surface of their bodies, forming various arrangements of gems that can differ between individuals. Sableye also move about very erratically, jittering and convulsing with every step as their heads twitch from side to side. This only adds to their eerie demeanors.
Their Mega Evolution appears to use the giant gem as a shield while one tries to target a weak spot. Unfortunately, they spend so much energy supporting the gem that they are left susceptible to sneak attacks.

aron,"To make its body, Aron digs out iron from the mountains for food. Sometimes hunger motivates Aron to go downhill to eat the railways and bridges, which may cause some big problems and is seen as a vermin.
",Iron Armor Pokémon,"steel,rock",1′04″,132.3
lairon,"Lairon eat even more iron than Aron, and are also far more territorial. Unlike their communal pre-evolutions, Lairon will fight for sole feeding rights in territories. They will bash heads with one another until one of them is defeated. The sound of their duels can be heard throughout their cavern homes. In addition to digging out iron ore for food, Lairon also drink spring water rich in minerals to fortify their armor. When they comes across springs, they will often drink so much that they will be unable to eat for the rest of the day.
Their affinity for iron has led to increasingly common encounters with human miners. As Lairon are highly aggressive Pokémon, miners are advised to abandon their work if approached by one because they will not hesitate to attack if they feel threatened. Once they are satiated with iron, they will generally leave without causing any more trouble. Lairon enjoy showing off their strength by bashing their heads against boulders. They gauge their power by the size and number of sparks that fly out upon contact, as well as by the number of scratches and dents on their carapaces.
",Iron Armor Pokémon,"steel,rock",2′11″,264.6
aggron,"Aggron are highly territorial, claiming entire mountains as their own. They are very protective of their mountains, going to great lengths to keep them safe. Most obviously, this means fending off intruders that attempt to trespass on their land. However, Aggron will also plant trees, divert streams, or rearrange boulders to clean up their domains. In particular, lone Aggron have been known to restore areas ravaged by rockslides and wildfires back to their former glory without any outside help. Their ages can be measured by the lengths of their horns. One can also estimate how many battles an Aggron has fought in by the number of scars it bears on its metallic hide. They are very proud of their scars, showing them off as mementos of their conquests. Aggron use their horns to dig deep into bedrock in search of iron. Their digging will often expose new veins of iron for Aron and Lairon to consume. Though Aggron will relentlessly thrash those who deface their environments (such as miners and loggers), they will leave travelers who treat the land with respect alone. An extravagant Aggron-shaped helmet was discovered in a recent archaeological dig site, suggesting that Aggron were a popular heraldic element for ancient royalty.
",Iron Armor Pokémon,"steel,rock",6′11″,793.7
meditite,"Meditite are known for their extensive training in mountainous areas. They usually eat minimal food and rarely sleep as their day mainly consists of deep focus and meditation, though it often loses focus during these practices, leading to its training to become never-ending. While deep in meditation, this allows them to levitate off the ground.
",Meditate Pokémon,"fighting,psychic",2′00″,24.7
medicham,"Medicham is so fond of meditation that sometimes forget their own needs. It is said that through meditation, Medicham heightens the energy inside its body and sharpens its sixth sense. Some people claim to have seen levitating in full meditation Medicham. They usually live in temples located in places high and cold, with Meditite. This Pokémon hides its presence by merging itself with fields and mountains. They are especially known for their willpower, their agility in combat and power with martial arts. Part of this flexibility arises precisely from his meditations, which give the power to reach to anticipate enemy movements. They are also able to sense the feelings of its trainer, similar to Gardevoir and Lucario. 
",Meditate Pokémon,"fighting,psychic",4′03″,69.4
electrike,"Electrike generates electricity using friction from the atmosphere. In arid wind stations, its body becomes inflamed and throws sparks violently. It resembles a dog or wolf with characteristics of lightning and electricity. It usually live near Power Plants. But if there is a human that will feed him, it will earn his friendship. It runs so fast, it escapes the human eye. Electrike is a Pokémon that can live in human homes, because it is very friendly with the people that own it. It can recognize by smell if a person is friend or foe. Therefore, it is also a good Pokémon guardian. They are fond of rubbing up against carpets and other surfaces that generate lots of static electricity. This is because these surfaces recharge their fur faster than they would normally. Trainers should note that grooming Electrike with metal brushes is dangerous, as metal conducts their fur's electricity easily.
",Lightning Pokémon,electric,2′00″,33.5
manectric,"They are solitary hunters that rarely appear before people. Because of their mysterious nature, in older times people believed that Manectric were born from lightning. This was supported by the fact that Manectric tend to make their nests in spots where lightning has struck, possibly due to the higher level of electrical activity in such areas. Places with Manectric also tend to have more thunderstorms because of how these Pokémon can conjure them. The sparks Manectric discharge while idle have been known to ignite forest fires. Consequently, most habitats Manectric inhabit are devoid of large trees, with only sparse, dry grasses sprouting from the earth.

It is very compassionate towards its friends, and is known to cry upon witnessing a friend lose a battle. It's kind are commonly referred to as cheerleaders for these actions.Wild Plusle are playful, but timid, Pokémon. Though they enjoys goofing around, but rarely initiate contact with others. They group together with their siblings, but will pair up with wild Minun when given the chance. Once a Plusle and Minun rub tails with one another, they are essentially bound for life and will never leave the other’s side. Plusle are known for climbing on top of telephone poles to feed on electricity. Once they can no longer hold any more, they will climb back down and share their electricity with Minun, who are not as adept at climbing.

carvanha,"Carvanha, just like nonfiction piranhas, form in schools and violently attack anything that might invade their territory. Although dangerous in large groups, a single Carvanha poses no threat to humans or Pokémon. 
By using its powerful sharp jaws, Carvanha is able to rip apart the hulls of boats and even chew through solid steel. It also shares a strong rivalry with Basculin and will compete for food if both species cross paths with one another.
",Savage Pokémon,"water,dark",2′07″,45.9
sharpedo,"Sharpedo are known to be smart, and are independent. It's unusual for them to group together. They use their extremely powerful teeth for hunting prey.
Throughout the vast oceans of the world, there are no aquatic Pokémon feared more than Sharpedo. Nicknamed the “bullies of the sea” (also “gangsters,” “bandits,” or “ruffians”), Sharpedo are notorious for attacking boats, submarines, and even divers who dare venture into their territories. Their skin is unique in texture; rubbing in the direction of rear to mouth, it feels as rough as sandpaper and can cut skin simply by brushing past. In the opposite direction, though, it is as smooth as steel. This quality along with their hydrodynamic body shape allows them to reach speeds of up to 75 mph (120 km/h) by jetting water through their bodies. Though they can only do this for short periods of time, it is more than enough to ram holes into boats or slam into larger prey. They are also infamous for boldly hunting down Wailmer.
When a Sharpedo Mega Evolves, its beastly instincts are further highlighted through its barbaric and cruel bashes and shooting spikes that can propel it forward in a blast and subsequently inflicting immensely agonizing damages onto its foes. However, it is also known that many Sharpedo in this form are actually in pain due to the overflowing energy of Mega Evolution.
",Brutal Pokémon,"water,dark",5′11″,195.8
wailmer,"A Wailmer sprays jets of sea water from its nostrils. One is able to become a large bouncy ball if it swallows water; the more water it swallows, the bouncier it becomes.
Wailmer spend much of their time swimming in the open ocean in pods. On bright and sunny mornings, however, they may begin swimming towards the shoreline. They can survive for short periods of time outside of the water, taking full advantage of this by beaching themselves on the sand to play. They generally stay far enough away from crowded areas for this to not be an issue, though. Their nostrils are located above their eyes; for fun, they will startle fishermen by suddenly spouting water from them. 
Wailmer eat tons of plankton daily, filtering water through their sieve-like teeth (actually baleen). If they lose too much of their stored water, they will begin to dry out and become lethargic. Kind beach-goers will often take the time to dump buckets of water onto dry Wailmer to rejuvenate them. According to Alolan legend, pods of Wailmer like to beach themselves because they once were land-dwelling Pokémon—a fact that science in fact supports, though through evolution rather than the mystical transformation by the gods that Wailmer underwent in the myth. 
Wailmer overall eat large amounts of food every day; Wishiwashi is their favorite prey.
",Ball Whale Pokémon,water,6′07″,286.6
wailord,"Wailord are the largest Pokémon of all, and travel in pods across great expanses of the ocean. Despite ther immense sizes, they are surprisingly light, allowing them to float on water. They herd shoals of small prey into a ball and swallows them whole, with their favorite food being Wishiwashi.
These social Pokémon protect their own; if one member of a pod is attacked by a predator like Sharpedo or Dhelmise, the others will come to its aid and surround the attacker. When hunting, Wailord pods will leap out of the water, landing back down with humongous splashes to disorient prey and make capturing them in single gulps easy. They will also use this tactic to confuse foes. Though they must surface to breathe air every once in a while, they can dive as far as 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) with a single breath. They are slow swimmers, which unfortunately makes them targets for many poachers who value them for their uniquely airy blubber. If attacked, Wailord will jet water at opponents using Water Spout to knock them away.

numel,"Numel are sturdy Pokémon, capable of carrying loads of up to 220&#160;lbs (10&#160;kg) on their backs. However, they are also rather dim-witted, unable to sense pain in most parts of their bodies. Their humps are filled with molten magma reaching temperatures of 2,200&#160;°F (1,100&#160;°C). When it rains, their magma cools and thickens, making them slower and more lethargic.When Numel use Fire-type attacks, their humps shrink; if their backs completely flatten, then they have used up all of their magma and must replenish it (in the wild, they do so by drinking lava flowing out of volcanoes; trained can use magma substitutes for Slugma and Magcargo found in most Poké Marts). In volcanic areas during ancient times, humans often used Numel to carry heavy cargo up mountain trails. Such a trend still carries on in some rural settlements today, where Numel farms rent trained Numel to hiking tourists. Numel absolutely cannot stand being hungry; if they begin to feel famished, they will immediately stop moving and will not start again until they are fed.

camerupt,"Its body contains amounts of molten lava of 18,000 °F (10,000 °C), which erupts out of its humps if the Pokémon is angered. Camerupt live within the craters of active volcanoes, drinking magma that oozes out from the ground. They store this magma within the humps on their backs, which are actually made of modified bone.Every 10 years or so, these humps will erupt on their own, without Camerupt forcing them to.Camerupt are mostly aloof, ignoring anything that doesn’t go out of its way to provoke them. However, they will become uncontrollably angry if something strikes their faces, erupting magma out of their humps recklessly and charging blindly at anything that moves. When Camerupt rampage, they will not cease until they have expelled all of the magma in their bodies.
",Eruption Pokémon,"fire,ground",6′03″,485
torkoal,"Torkoal dig through mountains in search of coal. When they find some, they will store it in their hollow shells. In battle, Torkoal burn coal for energy, releasing smoke from their shells and nostrils. The sound they make when doing so is akin to that of a locomotive horn. Torkoal communicate with using this sound, altering its pitch, duration, and volume to convey different messages. The four hexagonal indents in their shells are also speculated to be used in communication; when Torkoal burn coal, these indents glow with varying intensities depending on how much coal they are burning. The speed at which Torkoal expel smoke is indicative of their health, with healthy Torkoal spewing it out quickly and forcefully.
When threatened, Torkoal will use the move Smokescreen by exhaling black soot out of their orifices. Then, while attackers are blinded by smoke, they will attempt to flee as quickly as they can (albeit, this isn't very swiftly). Larger Torkoal require more coal to stay active, but can also withstand longer periods of time without any of it; they will eventually become unable to move and die without fuel, however. Torkoal are common sights in coal mines, with dozens congregating around areas of exposed coal.

The pearl on its head, which is from a Clamperl, serves as a psychokinetic amplifier, and the bigger the pearl, the more power, so any Spoink is always searching for a bigger, better pearl. They have a diet mostly consisting of underground mushrooms. 
Spoink possess mild powers of manipulation, persuading other Pokémon to dig them for them in return for a share of the meal. If Spoink drop their pearls, they grow tired and lose their abilities. They also will bounce more erratically without the extra weight. They will therefore compulsively steal round objects and place them on their heads until they can find new pearls.

Most Spinda live in groups of a few dozen. They feed on shoots and Berries, though they have a very strong aversion to Persim Berries. In the evening, groups of Spinda will begin to dance wildly, teetering and spinning aimlessly. They will continue this strange dancing until the moon rises before collapsing onto the floor in a daze. This ritualistic dancing is believed to be a form of recreation, thought to give the Spinda involved an effect similar to hallucinogenic drugs.
",Spot Panda Pokémon,normal,3′07″,11
trapinch,"They burrow deep in the sand and dig out bowl-shaped pits, making their nests right in the centers. Rather than actively going out and hunting for food, Trapinch simply wait for unwary prey to stumble into their holes; the steep sides cause additional sand to fall onto anything that tries to escape, only dragging unfortunate victims further in, where Trapinch await with open jaws. Then, Trapinch will simply reconstruct their pits and wait for new victims to fall in. When faced with particularly evasive prey, they may use their lower jaws as shovels to fling sand at their targets and cause them to lose their footing. To sleep, Trapinch simply burrow underneath the sand of their nests.
They can survive for a whole week without water; in fact, they often have to, since they spend most of their time waiting in their pits. If trainers accidentally fall into a Trapinch pits, it should be noted that Trapinch have very heavy jaws; if their victims manage to tip their heads over, they will have great difficulty righting themselves up again on their own. This vulnerability also makes them easy prey for smaller predators like Sandile.

The red covers over their eyes protect their vision from abrasive sand, allowing them to navigate without hindrance. In popular myth, it is said that Flygon will appear to desert travelers in danger, particularly those being attacked by rogue bands of Pokémon or thieves. They will then whisk away the aggressors in sandstorms if the defending parties are not guilty of any wrongdoing themselves. Recent studies show that some Flygon engage in cooperative hunting with Krookodile; the Flygon whip up sandstorms to conceal the Krookodile, who ambush the hapless victim. The two then split the catch evenly.

cacnea,"Cacnea live in arid deserts, surviving on tremendously meager amounts of water. The drier and hotter their environments are, the more beautiful and fragrant the flowers on top of their heads grow; the flowers bloom only once a year, but remain fragrant year-round. They uses their flowers’ scents to attract prey, which they shoot down with thorns using Pin Missile. If this fails, Cacnea can also swing their spiky arms at foes like hammers by using Needle Arm. When they find oases, they will gorge themselves with water, filling their hollow bodies. They can last up to 30 days on this stored water. 
Cacnea are solitary Pokémon, wandering deserts alone. However, they are not territorial and will allow other Cacnea to pass nearby without conflict. When food is scarce, Cacnea can find sustenance by using Ingrain; they dig their roots deep into the sand to suck up nutrients like plants. However, the sustenance they gain from this is ultimately inefficient for supporting them in the long run, so they must eventually hunt and capture prey in order to survive.
",Cactus Pokémon,grass,1′04″,113.1
cacturne,"Cacturne become active in the dead of night, when desert temperatures often drop to near-freezing levels. They do this to prevent themselves from losing precious moisture in the hot, sweltering sun during the day. Cacturne hunt in packs, but aren't closely bonded with one another like most pack hunters; their relations are purely task-oriented without personal bonds. In their makeshift groups, Cacturne will follow weary travelers from far behind. If the travelers try and look behind them, the Cacturne will stop moving and pose as motionless cacti. Eventually, the travelers, already weary from the day's heat, will be overcome by paranoia and collapse onto the sand. It is only then that the Cacturne will approach and attack. Oftentimes, the only trace left after Cacturne attacks are piles of dry bones. 
It is said that living thousands of years in the sandy desert has turned their blood into sand; although Cacturne “blood” is much thicker than that of most other Pokémon, since it is essentially their sap, it certainly is not sand, even though popular media likes to depict it that way.

Altaria are also known to fly high up in the sky, resembling cottony clouds. They catch updrafts with their buoyant wings to rise effortlessly in the sky. They enjoy flying through clouds, blending in seamlessly into their surroundings. When Altaria roost, they fold their wings inwards and preen their feathers to clean them. They do this every few hours to keep their wings from growing too heavy with dirt. Altaria are in fact famous for their beautiful, melodic singing. They trill with light soprano voices as they fly, making listeners feel like they are dreaming. When they see loved ones, they will engulf them with their pillowy wings and begin to hum.

zangoose,"Zangoose are aggressive Pokémon that are known for their fierce rivalry with Seviper. If they sense Seviper near them, their fur will bristle and they will stand up, ready to attack. Their feud seems almost genetic, with even newborn Zangoose becoming aggressive when Seviper are nearby. The scars on their bodies are likely from duels with Seviper. They only bare their claws when attacking, leaving them withdrawn outside of battle. They are also shown to be very territorial and often travels in groups of 3.

Additionally, it makes it difficult for foes to grasp them, especially important because Barboach often live in shallow water where they can easily be spotted by aerial predators. If this film dries, they will become weak and lethargic.Barboach are usually submerged in mud, leaving only their whiskers poking out. Their whiskers are extremely sensitive, acting like radars to help them navigate murky waters. The barbs can also sense passing prey, and can detect smell and taste at the same resolution as the human tongue. Barboach are not very picky eaters and will consume nearly anything they find. They can be seen scavenging the remains of the meals of other Pokémon or eating rotting plant material if food is scarce.

They are nocturnal, burying into the mud to sleep during the day. At night, they emerge to eat whatever they can find, waiting patiently at the bottoms of their ponds; as long as it is alive, Whiscash will swallow it whole (they will sometimes even consume inanimate objects), along with a healthy gulp of muck from beneath as well. They make their nests by carving out shallow bowls in mud. Whiscash have poor eyesight and instead use their highly sensitive whiskers to navigate their murky surroundings. They are so sensitive, in fact, that they can sense minute vibrations of the earth and alert Whiscash of earthquakes before they even occur. Due to their territoriality, they become very hostile when foes enter their land. When threatened, they will go berserk and thrash about wildly to generate earthquakes with radii of over 3 miles (5 kilometers). They will also generate smaller tremors to scare out potential prey from the silt. It is said seeing a leaping Whiscash is an omen of an impending quake.

Once it molts, Crawdaunt is more vulnerable to attacks and will avoid any fight by burrowing inside stream beds. 
Because of its rough and dangerous nature, Crawdaunt can be very challenging to trainers who want to raise it.

cradily,"Cradily were found rooted on rocks in warm seas. Like Lileep, they have fake eye spots on their bells to deter predators, with their real eyes located on their ""true"" bodies; their insides are very soft, held in place by the firmer green flesh surrounding it. 
Cradily can uproot themselves and slowly crawl around with their stubby legs. They often nest in shallow waters, rooting to rocks and using their bodies to weigh themselves down and prevent themselves from being washed away by rough waves and tides. When the tide goes down, they roam around beaches to dig up prey from the sand. They can also crawl on the sea floor, using their tentacles to ensnare passing prey. They can extend these tentacles to three times their usual length. 
Because Cradily lack teeth, their instead secrete acid from these tentacles to dissolve prey externally before feeding. This acid also paralyzes entangled victims so they cannot escape in the meantime. When the weather grew cold during an ice age and their prey migrated south, Cradily were too slow to keep up and likely went extinct because of this.

feebas,"Though they may look weak and feeble, Feebas are surprisingly hardy Pokémon. They can survive in weed-choked ponds, even ones with very little water left.-though a few Feebas maniacs certainly exist. To compound this problem, though they can be very plentiful in many areas where other Pokémon cannot be found, they also have the tendency to cluster in large numbers in very specific locations; despite being weak and defenseless, congregating en masse reduces the chance of each individual of being preyed upon—strength in numbers, essentially. This behavior makes them difficult to locate. Once found, though, their dimness makes them easy catches (though they are rather fast). Because they look quite ragged and unappetizing, though, many predators don't even bother trying to seek them out, allowing them to remain plentiful in their refuges. Feebas live near the mud at the bottoms of lakes; they are notable for being able to tolerate both fresh and salt water and are currently being studied for their hardiness.

They can essentially turn invisible at a moment’s notice, making detection extremely difficult for predators who rely primarily on their senses of sight. When hunting, Kecleon blend into foliage and wait patiently for prey to wander by. Then, they lash out their long, sticky tongues to capture victims. Kecleon also change color based on their moods and health; what hue signifies what emotion can vary between individuals, though darker shade tend to correspond to healthier individuals.

In battle, they utilize the negative emotions they collect by pulling off moves like Spite and Grudge. They, however, cannot tolerate light, hiding in the shadows during the day. 
It is said that though Shuppet may appear evil because of their ability to feed on hateful emotions, they actually act out due to their loneliness. In fact, Shuppet actually can cause people to forgive others by literally consuming their grudges, and some even welcome them for this reason. Trainers who raise Shuppet assert that they can be kind and affectionate if cared for properly, even feeding on positive emotions rather than negative ones.

Popular legend says that once Banette are brought to life, their sole goal is to hunt down and exact vengeance on the children that had abandoned ​them. Their entire beings are powered by vengefulness. Banette are in fact fond of placing curses on their enemies; by sticking pins into their own bodies, they can use Curse to turn their pain into their foes’ suffering. Many believe that once Banette succeed in taking revenge on their old owners, they will unzip their mouths to allow the entities within to escape to the spirit world and their bodies to revert back into toys, their worldly business now taken care of. Other say that properly caring for a Banette will satisfy the spirit within and cause it to let go of its grudge; the result is the same, with its body reverting back into a harmless doll.

Chimecho defend themselves from enemies by letting loose ultrasonic waves to knock foes away. However, they are kind-hearted and try not to hurt them. To deter attackers, they emit cries that echo inside their bodies and sound like beautifully ethereal wind chimes. The sound unsettles foes with its unnaturalness, keeping them at bay. Their tails are prehensile; they use them to pick up nuts and Berries from bushes to eat.

When the sun sets, they will emerge from their caves to play in the moonlight. They enjoy squeezing up against other Wynaut to increase their own endurance. While doing so, Wynaut teach each other how to strike back with powerful counterattacks like their evolutions.
Wynaut enjoy eating sweet fruit, picking them off of trees using their ear-like arms. They are attracted to the fragrance of Berry trees and often can be seen clustering in orchards at night. In particular, Wynaut enjoy eating Liechi Berries, and will eat them exclusively given the chance.

They only venture out when there is snow, spending most of the spring and summer inside caves (Alolan Snorunt are more tolerant of heat). They can easily withstand temperatures as low as -150&#160;°F (-100&#160;°C); they regulate their body heat by shivering, helping them cope with such cold environments. In fact, their diets consist entirely of snow and ice, which they happily munch on while wandering through snow-covered areas. In the fall, Snorunt can occasionally be seen hiding together under piles of fallen leaves. 
They are quite a few pieces of folklore attached to Snorunt. One legend suggests that seeing a wild Snorunt at midnight indicates heavy snow the following day. Another says that if a Snorunt visits a home, all the members of that household will be prosperous for many generations to come. Indeed, in northern regions, almost all children from well-off families will have encountered a Snorunt at some point in their childhood.

They are not very strong swimmers, and instead use their fish-shaped tails to lure in prey. The “eyes” on their tails glow as they wave them back and forth, fooling victims into swimming closer. Then, they unhinge their jaws and swallow their victims whole. Huntail swim by wriggling their bodies like snakes. On occasion, one of their teeth may fall off as they feed. 
Huntail may occasionally be found near the surface of the water, but such sightings are extremely rare; the significant difference in pressure from their natural habitats is detrimental to their health, so surfacing Huntail are likely very ill and in need of immediate medical attention.

Gorebyss sometimes feed on seaweed growing between rocks, but they are more well known for their surprisingly cruel tendencies; they can pierce the flesh of prey with their siphon-like mouths and suck out their body fluids. The drained carcass then sinks to the ocean floor, where it provides valuable sustenance for benthic scavengers.
Despite this unsettling feeding method, Gorebyss are lauded as beautiful and graceful swimmers. Watching them swim is intensely mesmerizing due to their impeccable form.

Like regular monkeys, Chimchar are able to climb the rocky ledges and cliffs of tall rocky mountains, where they usually live in the wild by making nests. They originally roamed the Sinnoh region in the wild, though over time, they have become a rare sight.
",Chimp Pokémon,fire,1′08″,13.7
monferno,"Like Chimchar, Monferno love to play around. However, they have become much more perceptive of the situations they are in and have learned to handle themselves more seriously in battle. Monferno are adept fighters, using both their flames and fists to defeat opponents. They can take advantage of their environments to the fullest extent, jumping off of walls and ceilings to attack foes aerially from unexpected angles. By enlarging the flames on their tails, Monferno can make themselves appear bigger to intimidate attackers. They also use this technique for spacing, warding foes off by making their flames bigger or drawing them closer by feigning exhaustion and weakening their fires. In the wild, Monferno live in packs of roughly a dozen members each with rigid pecking orders. Individuals are ranked based on the sizes of their flames when fully lit and the brightness of the blue “masks” on their faces; Monferno with the largest flames and the brightest masks are ranked the highest. Monferno in troops train each other by sparring in mock fights.
",Playful Pokémon,"fire,fighting",2′11″,48.5
infernape,"Infernape seems to be very energetic Pokémon as seen in anime. It never gives up. It is very loyal to its trainer and tries harder to win.. They use their great agility to toss foes around while pummeling them from all angles. They are capable of cloaking their limbs in flames to scorch foes with physical attacks. The crowns of fire on their heads burn more intensely as they become more heated in battle. These flames cannot be extinguished and are said to represent their undying, fiery spirits in combat. Outside of battle, Infernape retain the playful demeanors of their pre-evolutions. They will quickly assume more somber personas, however, when threatened, as their battling spirits overtake their bodies.
",Flame Pokémon,"fire,fighting",3′11″,121.3
piplup,"Piplup has a strong sense of self-esteem. It seldom accepts food and shelter that people give it because of its pride.They almost always keep their chests puffed up as a display of pride. Piplup are difficult to train, as they are too proud to take orders from trainers, and it takes much effort to bond with such prideful Pokémon. However, their resilience and cute appearances make them popular First partner Pokémon in the Sinnoh region.
",Penguin Pokémon,water,1′04″,11.5
prinplup,"Prinplup normally prefer a solitary life. This is because they are all dignified and proud of themselves, which makes them difficult to form groups with one another.When two Prinplup meet, they will engage in displays of dominance to assert control over disputed territory. By puffing out their chests and waving around their wings, each Prinplup will attempt to appear larger than the other in order to “win” the fight.  
",Penguin Pokémon,water,2′07″,50.7
empoleon,"Like its pre-evolutions, it is a Pokémon with a strong self-esteem, but it is more aggressive. If offended, it will attack the offender with the blades on its wings.trainers who have raised them from Piplup will have finally earned their respect and loyalty. Traded or wild-caught Empoleon, on the other hand, are notoriously difficult to train due to their pride. Empoleon live in small groups. While each member retains its own individuality and sense of self-worth, they have learned that teamwork in hunting yields far superior results when compared to solitary attempts.The Empoleon with the largest horns on their heads are the leaders of the groups.They are too proud to involve themselves in petty disputes, instead appearing aloof in most conflicts; however, they will viciously attack anyone that hurts their pride with the powerful Hydro Pump or devastating slashes with their wings. Though known for the hard work it takes to train one, their strength and willpower have made Empoleon mainstays for Sinnohan trainers able to handle the challenge. 
In ancient times, the people of Hisui once revered Empoleon to be the Master of the Waves.  
",Emperor Pokémon,"water,steel",5′07″,186.3
starly,empty,Starling Pokémon,"normal,flying",1′00″,4.4
staravia,"Like Starly, Staravia are rarely encountered alone, as they are almost invariably found in flocks with others of their kind. It seems that Staravia are aware of their weakness alone, hence their reluctance to engage in any kind of solitary activity. Staravia flocks stick together, with members being able to recognize each other on sight. They are territorial, staking out swathes of forest and defending their land from others. Should two flocks encounter each other, they will begin to bicker and engage in fierce aerial fights over disputed territory. The battles only end once all members of one of the flocks have been knocked out of the sky. Staravia feed mostly on insects. While Starly tend to go after slow, grounded prey like Wurmple, though, Staravia can seize aerial insects in mid-flight. They occasionally indulge themselves in fruits and nuts found within their forest habitats. Lone Staravia can easily be recognized by their shrill, harsh cries. They will not stop crying until they find their flocks, much to the chagrin of nearby residents.
",Starling Pokémon,"normal,flying",2′00″,34.2
staraptor,"Staraptor is implied to be a solitary Pokémon, leaving their Staravia flocks behind when they evolve, as they have gained enough strength to survive on their own.
Much like Taillow, they are also very aggressive and persistent, and never stops attacking their foes even if they are wounded.Staraptor are territorial and will defend their land with all of their strength. Even when injured, they will continue to ferociously fight back attackers. 
Unlike Starly or Staravia, Staraptor are carnivorous, feeding on fish and small mammals. Their talons are capable of carrying smaller Pokémon all the way back to their nests. 
They pride themselves on the arrangement of their head feathers, called “combs.” They will viciously attack those who dishevel them with the powerful Brave Bird. During their spare time, Staraptor can be seen preening and adjusting the feathers in their combs. During mating season, these combs are used to attract mates. Larger, glossier combs are considered more attractive, which is why they spend so much time fussing over their looks.
",Predator Pokémon,"normal,flying",3′11″,54.9
bidoof,"Bidoof live in groups around river banks, where they lay their eggs. They have to chew on rocks and wood to keep their teeth from growing too long.
Bidoof are exceptionally hard workers, laboring from dawn to dusk as they build and repair nests on the riverside. Even when finished with this task, they will gnaw down logs for their evolutions Bibarel to use in their dams, still intent on helping out.While Bidoof work, they focus all of their attention on their tasks, ignoring everything else around them. This has given them reputations for being unaware of things happening to them.
",Plump Mouse Pokémon,normal,1′08″,44.1
bibarel,"Bibarel builds its nest around water. These dams are made of roots and branches, and prevent water banks from overflowing. Bibarel are sensitive to small changes in water currents, allowing them to sense flash floods before they occur. When they feel deluges approaching, they will quickly reinforce their dams.
They spend their days cutting down new trees to patch up holes in their dams while making sure that they will not overflow. This rigorous inspection process is highly effective; within the last decade, there have been fewer overflows in Bibarel dams than there have in human ones. Because of this, communities who live near or in former riverbeds greatly appreciate Bibarel populations, holding festivals in honor of these diligent Pokémon.
",Beaver Pokémon,"normal,water",3′03″,69.4
kricketot,"Kricketot are famous for the xylophone-like sound their hard antennae make when they clang together. By shaking their heads back and forth, they can make their antennae ring musically; this is how Kricketot communicate with others of their kind. Though their antennae are mostly stiff, Kricketot can adjust them slightly near the tips. By subtly curling and uncurling their antennae, Kricketot can alter the lengths of their exposed sections, thereby changing the pitches they make when they clang together. Altering the pitch and the rhythm of their clattering enables Kricketot to send complex messages to their peers. During the mating season, male Kricketot will compete with each other to compose beautiful melodies in order to seduce mates. As their mating season coincides with the beginning of autumn, many people associate Kricketot songs with the arrival of fall. Their short legs make them rather clumsy at walking; they often stumble about while traveling, causing their antennae to clang together inadvertently (but still pleasantly and melodiously). 
",Cricket Pokémon,bug,1′00″,4.9
kricketune,"Kricketune have melodious cries that are easy on the ears. They are capable of composing melodies on the fly, often of a caliber rivaling that of professional musicians. Kricketune use songs to convey emotions, and are capable of making others around them feel similarly through their music. As they sing, they cross their knife-like arms across their chests. By allowing their cries to resonate within their bellies, they can produce a unique sound that is difficult to mimic with conventional instruments. Some villages hold Kricketune concerts in the autumn, where their wildly variable melodies are rated against one another. In battle, their musical capabilities manifest as the attack Bug Buzz. They use their sharp arms to slash foes that come too close, though they are also known to direct “symphonies” of Kricketot and Kricketune using their arms as well. When mating, suitors use size of their mustaches to display their virility. Then, pairs of Kricketune will compose duets they perform together to signify that they both have been “taken.”
",Cricket Pokémon,bug,3′03″,56.2
shinx,"Although Shinx is a tenderhearted Pokémon, they detest being betrayed.
In the wild, if a Shinx's claw is damaged, it loses the ability to communicate with the others and will be isolated from its pack.
When its tail tip shines brightly, it can send signals to its kind through shaking its tail. 
",Flash Pokémon,electric,1′08″,20.9
luxio,"Wild Luxio mostly live in small groups. However, the ones living in the urban areas might reside at dark, hidden places, sewers or even powerhouses, wandering alone.
Despite being a Sinnoh Pokémon, they're quite common in Kalos, especially in Lumiose City. Some of them inhabit the Isle of Armor.
",Spark Pokémon,electric,2′11″,67.2
luxray,"With eyes that glow in the dark, Luxray possesses the innate ability to see through solid surfaces; this allows it to easily track down its lost young or prey as well as detecting danger nearby. But doing so can drain a lot of its energies, thus it spends most of its time sleeping to recharge itself. When their families are threatened, Luxray will attack back ferociously with the powerful Thunder Fang.
One pride can hold as many as half a dozen Luxray, each with varying levels of dominance. The leader Luxray can be either of either gender, with their mates being second-in-command. The remaining Luxray are ranked based on their strength, challenging each other in battle to determine placement. This order determines who eats first at meals, leads the pack during prowls, and other aspects of life as well. Challenging leaders has the highest stakes of them all; losers are exiled from their prides, forced to start new ones on their own. A Luxray's primary job in its pride is to care for offspring and defend the family. They will also occasionally aid in hunts to take down larger foes.
Despite being a Sinnoh Pokémon, a lot of them mostly live in Kalos, especially in Lumiose City. Some also reside in the Isle of Armor.

",Bud Pokémon,"grass,poison",0′08″,2.6
roserade,"Roserade are known for their grace and beauty, both in and out of battle. Their movements have been compared to that of dancers.Like Mawile, Roserade are deceiving creatures that use their aroma to attract their prey.Roserade dance around the field with their thorny vines out, whipping them around to constrict and poison opponents. Their aroma sweetens as their toxins become more potent, leading some to believe that the toxins are in fact what produce the scent. However, the toxin and the scent in fact do not affect each other; sweeter scents tend to come from healthier Roserade, who also tend to produce more virulent poison.
",Bouquet Pokémon,"grass,poison",2′11″,32
cranidos,"They dwelled in ancient tropical jungles about 100,000,000 years ago. Their skulls are as hard as steel; as they travel through forests, they simply headbutt trees in their way rather than going around them; fossilized trunks are plentiful in rock layers where Skull Fossils are found. Cranidos also tackle prey headfirst to take them down. They are omnivorous—when not hunting, they can often be found eating ferns and other low-growing plants. They also forage the Berries knocked out of the trees and shrubs they destroy while charging. Cranidos live in herds of 15 to 20 members, consisting both of Cranidos and their evolutions Rampardos. While not the smartest Pokémon these herds find strength in numbers, using their heads to fend off attackers like Aerodactyl from all directions. While able to attain high speeds, Cranidos require lots of room in order to accelerate properly. In cramped areas, they become vulnerable due to their inability to headbutt at full speed. Cranidos likely went extinct due to an extended glacial period that killed off most of the plants that made up over half of their diets.
",Head Butt Pokémon,rock,2′11″,69.4
rampardos,"these Pokémon are not very intelligent (their brains are even smaller that those of Cranidos). They will charge at anything they perceive to be threats. This occasionally even includes inanimate objects like boulders and trees; one modern incident involves a just-revived Rampardos pulverizing a skyscraper. Rampardos charge recklessly through forests when pursuing pursuing prey, leaving trails of fallen trees behind. Rampardos will ram heads together to compete for dominance until one gives; their thick skulls ensures that this process is a very arduous and time-consuming ritual. Archaeological evidence shows that some ancient cultures in fact unearthed Rampardos skulls and used them as helmets in combat. Though popular culture often portrays Rampardos as having gone extinct due to their low intellect, most scientists agree that they died out during an ice age that killed off much of the currently existing life at the time; a cooling climate destroyed most of the tropical plants that they relied upon for survival.
",Head Butt Pokémon,rock,5′03″,226
shieldon,"100 million years ago, Shieldon lived in dense forests. It has a habit of polishing its face against tree trunks. It is speculated that few enemies would have considered challenging its armored face. It eats grass, tree roots, and&#160;Berries. Its fossils show no sign of damage to its face.
",Shield Pokémon,"rock,steel",1′08″,125.7
bastiodon,"Bastiodon, though slow, are very defensively strong. They are virtually invulnerable to frontal attacks, as their steel-hard faces can withstand immense damage. Though their rears and sides are not nearly as strong, they still are relatively tough compared to other species. Bastiodon live in herds of 30 or so members. They raise their young until adulthood. When their herds are threatened, Bastiodon will line up side by side and barricade their offspring; these impregnable walls easily defend Shieldon from most predators. This defense, however, is notably weak to aerial attacks. Because their fossils are often found together, it is believed Bastiodon frequently clashed with Rampardos. Their facial bones are so hard and oddly shaped that scientists once thought they were sort of horn or spike until the first Bastiodon was successfully resurrected. Despite their imposing size, Bastiodon are docile creatures. They spend most of their time traveling with their herds in search of Berries and grasses. They are thought to have died out due to an ice age; the cooling climate wiped out many plants, and their sluggishness and herd reliance made remaining lone Bastiodon easy targets for predators.
",Shield Pokémon,"rock,steel",4′03″,329.6
burmy,"If they have their cloak damaged during a battle, they will apply nigh materials to immediately create a new one. In warmer weather, they shed the outer layers of their cloaks to keep from overheating. Burmy seem to always find something to cover themselves in, no matter how barren their surroundings.
",Bagworm Pokémon,bug,0′08″,7.5
wormadam,"Most Wormadam are covered in either leaves and other plant materials, sand and gravel, or trash and metal scraps. However, these are hardly the only types of coverings found within the species. A Wormadam’s covering affects what attacks it can use in battle. Plant Cloak Wormadam can use leaves to execute Razor Leaf; Sandy Cloak Wormadam can utilize pebbles in Rock Blast; Steel Cloak Wormadam can manipulate metal scraps to use Mirror Shot. As Burmy alter the thickness of their cloaks to regulate their temperatures, Wormadam that evolve on cold days also tend to have thicker cloaks. 
A Wormadam's cloak is in fact a part of its body, with the fusion being suspected to have been caused by the energy generated by its evolution. Its cloak acts similar to fur and skin. As a result, this fused cloak never sheds. Sandy Cloak Wormadam's cloak is an effective defense, capable of repelling a Starly's pecking with ease, whereas Trash Cloak Wormadam uses its cloak as camouflage, as it helps it hide from predators.

combee,"Combee are able to stick together and build a large wall for protection and defense. They usually travel in swarms and they bring honey and other food sources to their leader, Vespiquen. Combee eat just enough to survive, giving all of the surplus to their queens; each head has a slightly different nectar preference. They are diurnal; at night, Combee colonies rest by stacking their bodies together to form hives protecting the queen. Their hexagonal bodies allow no space for intruders to slip through when they stack together. About a third of the Combee in a hive will be awake at any given time, keeping watch over their colony. 
Additionally, each head has its own preference on honey. Combee will attack any potential threats, not hesitating to give their lives to protect their queens. Combee are entirely subservient to their queens’ orders; should the queens go missing, their colonies will fly about worriedly in search of them, not eating or resting until they are found. Female Combee can be distinguished by a red mark on their main heads; only 1 in 8 Combee are female.
",Tiny Bee Pokémon,"bug,flying",1′00″,12.1
vespiquen,"Vespiquen are rarely seen in the wild, as they are almost constantly cloaked by walls of very protective Combee. Though capable of making honey, they rarely do so, relying on their Combee to bring back food for them. The six-celled undersides of their abdomens serve as nests for Combee grubs, which they (or rather, their workers) will protect at all costs. Conversely, the grubs will also protect their mothers with their lives. Much of the honey Vespiquen colonies collect goes towards feeding these offspring. There is only one Vespiquen in a hive; should another female Combee evolve, it will immediately be exiled by the reigning queen to form a new colony. The primary job of a Vespiquen is to birth and protect new Combee.
When their colonies falter, Vespiquen can produce pheromones to command their grubs to do their bidding; they can use Attack Order to wear down foes, Defend Order to strengthen their own defenses, or Heal Order to replenish energy. Individuals with stronger pheromones can command a larger number of grubs more effectively. Vespiquen will repay outsiders who help defend their hives from attackers graciously with generous amounts of honey. They will viciously attack those who steal honey, however.
",Beehive Pokémon,"bug,flying",3′11″,84.9
pachirisu,"Pachirisu are active Pokémon, generally hyper active during the day. When they sleep, Pachirisu like to curl their massive, fluffy tails round to the front of their bodies and use them as a pillow. They also like to chase and groom their tails. When a Pachirisu sheds its fur it shapes it into fur balls. These fur balls exhibit static. Pachirisu hides its favorite foods in these static puffs and stores them in tree holes. It does this to protect the food—if a human or other Pokémon try to take the food, they will get shocked from the static.
Pachirisu are generally found in tree tops in forests, as well as the outskirts of forests and near Power Plants.
Pachirisu is known to eat mainly berries. Its diet is similar to that of Pikachu.
",EleSquirrel Pokémon,electric,1′04″,8.6
buizel,"Buizel live in fast-moving rivers. Although Buizel can hold their breaths for long periods of time, they must still surface to breathe. They inflate their sacs to keep their heads afloat as they scan for prey. They are primarily piscine, though they will also feed on bivalves as well. 
Young Buizel are very playful, as they can&#160;often be seen splashing together in the water. They outgrow this behavior as they age, but still remain very friendly. 
On land, though not as agile as they are in the water, Buizel are still relatively fast, as they will sometimes venture onto shore should their sacs become damaged. They wrap their tails around reeds when sleeping to stay anchored.

cherubi,"Despite its small size, Cherubi can often be seen nimbly dashing and jumping about. This is because like Bounsweet, the Cherry Pokémon's  nutrient ball often causes it to be targeted by other Pokémon. It's said to be very sweet and delicious, often causing bird Pokémon to attack it. Starly in particular are notorious for preying upon Cherubi, as they sometimes try to peck the ball off. Ironically, the ball detaches on its own when Cherubi sucks it dry of nutrients, so it becomes food for other Pokémon regardless of if it manages to escape predation.
Otherwise, like many Grass type Pokémon, Cherubi loves to sunbathe. It also has a tendency to hide in trees to escape being preyed on, especially Honey Trees. In fact, they can be found hiding in said trees all over the Sinnoh region. To lure them out, one must slather honey on the bark, enticing the Pokémon to feed.  
",Cherry Pokémon,grass,1′04″,7.3
cherrim,"Every time a Cherrim blooms, it releases all of its anger to keep itself happy. Once hit by beams of sunlight, however, they bloom into the Sunshine Form. In this form, Cherrim are very active and excitable, basking fully in the sun’s rays by facing all of their petals towards it. They uses this precious time under the sun to photosynthesize as much energy as they can, since they are unable to do so in its other form.
They can store large amounts of sugars in their bodies, which they use to endure long periods in the Overcast Form. In the Sunshine Form, they appear eternally joyful, while in Overcast Form they seem constantly gloomy. Once the sunlight wanes, Cherrim close their petals and return to the Overcast Form, patiently awaiting for the sun to return. Their petals are deceptively tough, protecting them from pecking bird Pokémon.
Cherrim live on tree branches or tree tops in order to absorb sunlight.

Despite their aloofness, Gastrodon are actually carnivores. They catch their prey, which they proceed to melt with their mucus prior to slurping them up.
",Sea Slug Pokémon,"water,ground",2′11″,65.9
ambipom,"Because Ambipom's two tails are so dexterous, it rarely uses its arms after evolving. Groups of Ambipom will sometimes link tails as a sign of friendship. Ambipom can be territorial when it's defending its favorite trees, but it also has a soft side. It shows affection by hugging its Trainer tightly with both of its tails.

",Blimp Pokémon,"ghost,flying",3′11″,33.1
buneary,"Buneary is extremely wary of its surroundings. When feeling threatened, it will perk up its ears or even uncoiling them to deliver a powerful hit that can reduce boulders into dusts and remnants. Having both of its ears rolled up is a sign of it feeling unwell in terms of its mind or body. 
When feeling cold, it tucks itself with its fur to keep itself warm and cozy.
",Rabbit Pokémon,normal,1′04″,12.1
lopunny,"A Lopunny always remains vigilant to its surrounding environment. Whenever one perceives a threat, it deliver powerful and destructive kicks or use its ears as whips to fend itself from its enemies. This species hate ones who touch their ears roughly and will not hesitate to attack them if they do so. They run with sprightly jumps to help them escape easier. In fact, Lopunny are very timid and are quick to sprint off at the first sign of danger.
When there is no threat, they are very conscious of their looks and never fail to groom their ears. They will still become aggressive when their ears are not being touched gently.
They change and regrow their fur and coats twice a year. When summer is over, their coats are replaced by thick fur that holds lots of insulating air in order to prepare themselves for winter. 
",Rabbit Pokémon,normal,3′11″,73.4
mismagius,"Unlike its pre-evolution, Misdreavus, it's no longer mischievous but becomes mature and steady, so it turns into an ally of its trainer instead of a little partner. Because of its powerful moves, it's easier to rely on.
Sometimes, Mismagius can be considered as elusive, since nobody can portend when it will torture or give blessings to people on a whim, so wild ones are always dreaded.  
",Magical Pokémon,ghost,2′11″,9.7
honchkrow,"One Honchkrow commands a group of Murkrow. If a Murkrow fails to obey it, then it will be punished, and the leading Honchkrow will take flight to hunt down disappointments in order to enforce total loyalty from their henchmen. They rarely leave their nests, and instead ""hire"" Murkrow henchmen to do their biddings, paying them with shiny objects, which Murkrow hoard compulsively, and food. Their Murkrow cronies collect food and valuables and bring them back to these Honchkrow bosses. Honchkrow will then dole out just enough pay their henchmen and take the rest for themselves.
As they wait for their Murkrow to return, Honchkrow enjoy preening their feathers. When necessary, they can emit a distinctive cry to summon all of their Murkrow to them; over a 100 may respond to a single call. Some call them ""Summoners of the Night"" because of this. They are extremely territorial, leaving their nests is to defend their domains from other Honchkrow in duels to the death. The Murkrow of losing sides are then subject to the winning Honchrow's whims. Honchkrow will only ever dirty their feathers in order to deal the finishing blow on particularly troublesome enemies.

glameow,"Glameow can be fickle and spiteful — especially when it is hungry and its Trainer hasn't fed it yet. It may show its displeasure by hooking its claws into its Trainer's nose. When it is happy, its tail dances like a ribbon. However, it can also be very sweet and cuddly, making it a good pet, and will purr when it's feeling affectionate. It is very devoted to its Trainer if it is treated nicely, as shown with Zoey’s Glameow and Dawn's mother Johanna’s Glameow.
",Catty Pokémon,normal,1′08″,8.6
purugly,"It has an grumpy appearance, and is known for sleeping wherever it wants, even if it has to fight a wild Pokémon to sleep in its territory. They are called the 'Tiger Cat' Pokémon, referring to its tiger-like stripes and its aggressive disposition. It uses the white fluff on its tail to squeeze the fat in its swollen gut towards its chest and rump in order to make itself look bigger and deter attackers. 
",Tiger Cat Pokémon,normal,3′03″,96.6

",Bell Pokémon,psychic,0′08″,1.3
stunky,"Stunky spray their fluid only as a defense mechanism; they can only shoot about a half-dozen times before having to recharge their scent glands, a process that can take up to a week. To make up for this, they will first give off a variety of warning signals to scare foes off without shooting; they will hiss, stamp their feet, and then finally raise their tails before spraying. Stunky will aim for the face, and can spray from up to 16 feet (5 meters) away. After being doused once, most foes learn to recognize the warnings and flee before getting doused. Oddly, Stunky seem to be unharmed by Combee swarms, walking right through them unfazed when searching for Honey.

skuntank,"Skuntank cannot see upwards very well, and are thus very susceptible to aerial attacks. Skuntank dig their nests into flat ground, marking the surrounding area to warn intruders of their presence. Skuntank are distrustful Pokémon. They dislike humans in their territory and will try to stay away if possible. Skuntank have been known to ignite their sprays to break apart walls of Combee and access valuable Honey. They may either fight or flee when they sense danger.
",Skunk Pokémon,"poison,dark",3′03″,83.8
bronzor,"Bronzor are ancient Pokémon believed to have been around since man first formed a civilization. Archaeologists have discovered bronze tools shaped like Bronzor buried in ancient Sinnohan tombs; no one is quite sure what the connection is, but some believe that ancient societies thought that Bronzor had some kind of mystical power and tried to replicate it through their implements. The herb-shaped pattern on their backs, it was said, is what held their power. 
Researchers speculate that the plant-like design indicate that Bronzor had some connection with harvests and fertility. Others believe that in the past, they reflected like mirrors, their mysterious powers letting onlookers gaze into the past. It is said that a shined Bronzor will always reflect the truth, though the Pokémon dislike being polished. 
Bafflingly, when scientists attempted to take an X-ray of a Bronzor to examine its body structure, the image came out blank. Alternative research attempting to solve the many mysteries surrounding them has also turned up inconclusive. 
",Bronze Pokémon,"steel,psychic",1′08″,133.4
bronzong,"Bronzong can undergo long periods of dormancy. When in this state, their eyes turn white, they stop floating, and they become immobile. Scientists believe can remain like this essentially indefinitely, and therefore conclude that they had been “asleep” for about 2,000 years. When angered, Bronzong let out a warning cry that rings out like the tolling of a bell. 
Additionally, historians believe that Bronzong were once revered as “bringers of plentiful harvests”. Ancient civilizations thought that by ringing their gong-like bells, Bronzong could open portals to other dimensions and summon rain clouds. People would ​leave out offerings and complete ritualistic dances in hopes of appeasing these Pokémon during poor weather. 
",Bronze Bell Pokémon,"steel,psychic",4′03″,412.3
bonsly,"Bonsly thrive in arid environments, as their bodies cannot tolerate much moisture. However, they stand out starkly against dull backgrounds, so they tend to camouflage with trees in wooded areas (albeit away from streams). They sometimes wander into parks for similar reasons; one may occasionally see Bonsly fleeing from gardens when sprinkler systems turn on. Bonsly are often found “crying;” in fact, they are not upset, but rather regulating their moisture levels by excreting excess fluids out of their eyes. They in fact exude two types of fluids this way. The first is salty and similar in composition to human sweat. The other is much more astringent, and is used as a bittering agent in some cuisines. The more humid their surroundings, the more they will weep.
In battle, this skill also goads enemies into letting their guards down. Bonsly are relatively skilled at mimicking trees, capable of remaining still for long periods of time. They dig small holes in the ground and bury themselves halfway, posing as small saplings. Like Sudowoodo, however, attempting to water them will cause them to uproot and scamper away. When threatened, Bonsly will try to flee, but may throw themselves at foes as a last resort. Due to their weight, this can be a very painful maneuver. The dull luster of their green orbs increases as they dry out, acting as a sign of their moisture level.

happiny,"Happiny are usually well-behaved and innocent Pokémon, though they are also naïve and have childish behavioral patterns. They love to imitate Chansey and carry round white things, but since they aren't old enough to lay eggs, they carry small pebbles or Oval Stones instead. They often take the first objects they like and get stuck as a result. While they sometimes lend their pebbles to their friends, they get very upset and throw a tantrum if the pebble is taken by force or if the pebble is not returned. They also have a habit of making people stumble or trip due to wandering around their feet.

chatot,"Their tongues are structurally similar to those of humans, enabling them to repeat nearly any word that they hear. They can also copy the cries of other Pokémon. Chatot use this ability to avoid predators and fool prey; by mimicking their targets, they can pretend to be members of the same species and thus avoid detection.
Chatot have great memories and can remember any sound they hear. They add these noises to their repertoires, which they can pull out of to construct and sing patchwork melodies. They swing their tails back and forth like metronomes keep time.
These intelligent Pokémon can learn by observation and experience; for example, they may scare foes away by copying the cries of their predators, or draw prey closer by producing corresponding mating calls.

gible,"Gible loves to bite anything, and that can be a pain for its Trainer if the Trainer gets bitten themselves. This habit of biting anything is probably instinctive, and it is very hard to train them to control their urges. It is a strong Pokémon in battle, but it often hurts itself due to its own clumsiness.

gabite,"Gabite is often territorial and predatory. When in battle, it uses its tough scales as armor. Its scales are also known to make good medicine when grounded up. Gabite loves shiny things. It seeks treasures in caves often digging deep into the earth and it hoards all the loot in its nest and guards it fiercely. Sometimes, they will steal Carbink and keep them at its nest. When they see Sableye attacking Carbink, they often get jealous and may attack Sableye out of this.

Being carnivores, If they ever irrupt into a flock of bird Pokémon, they will not hesitate to swallow the entire flock. They always have violent disputes with Salamence, their natural rival, when hunting for food. They are loyal and friendly towards their trainers though, as demonstrated by Prof. Sycamore's Garchomp in the anime. 
They are rarely seen in the wild as they live in caves. 
Upon Mega Evolving, Garchomp will become uncontrollably savage and aggressive due to their prided wings have become scythes. They won't cease throwing into a fit of ferocious rage and will even slice their enemies into scraps.

munchlax,"Unlike Snorlax, Munchlax are very active Pokémon. They spend almost all of their time walking or running -or more accurately, waddling- around in search of food. They eat their own body weight in food every day, and they rarely chew food before swallowing. They hide leftovers in their fur to save for later, but often forget about them, leaving the morsels to rot on their bodies. 
Consequently, wild Munchlax frequently smell of decomposing refuse. They will still gladly consume these spoiled items, however, as they can eat just about anything without experiencing any ill effects thanks to their robust stomachs. In fact, a Munchlax sharing its possibly-rotten stored food with someone is a sure sign of trust. Despite how much they eat, Munchlax rarely are ever full; they constantly are looking for more to eat. 
Occasionally, they can be found wandering around houses; they will squeeze their way through small openings or windows to eat food left out for pets. Some people have even reported Munchlax raiding pantries, cabinets, and refrigerators in search of food, eating everything they can find in the process. Munchlax hate confrontation and will flee at the first sign of danger, though, so they are thankfully easy to scare off.

Due to their extreme loyalty, some Riolu don't bond with just anyone, meaning despite patiently waiting for the right trainer they are known to be picky like Ash's Riolu. On the other hand, because of their type, they have extraordinary energy and endurance. They can also walk barefoot for a short time on a journey, and some of them can even run through the whole night or across canyons. Riolu are even to be able to react to aura from inside the egg before ever hatching and even emit it.
They only approve people who are kindhearted to befriend and mingle with them, while ones who are wicked will be forever despised and shunned by them.
Due to their extreme rarity, nobody knows their exact habitats, although it is mentioned that they live in seclude mountains, caves and groves. Some reside in the Lucario Kingdom where the chosen ones are being taught to use Aura to protect the kingdom before evolving and passing down the ability.
Riolu are mainly omnivores, but domesticated ones can eat human food.

lucario,"Lucario are very reserved, prideful and very serious Pokémon and also extremely loyal to their trainers, but they can be also friendly and cooperative with strangers and their Pokémon.
According to Gurkinn in ""The Aura Storm!"", when a Lucario Mega Evolves, the power of their aura and their battling instinct is brought to the limit, so much so that when in battle a Lucario only focuses on their opponents. When a Lucario loses control of its aura in this stage it'll go wild, berserk and relentlessly attack them.
In the wild, Lucario live in packs and they are primarily carnivores, though domesticated ones can be seen eating plant based foods as well as other human food such as chocolate.

hippopotas,"Hippopotas spends its time bathing in sand and avoids water at all costs. It covers itself in sand as a protective measure against germs and expels sand instead of sweat. When it walks through the sand, it shuts its nostrils. It also keeps its mouth open while traveling in sand, swallowing any sand and prey along the way. Hippopotas are more active during the day and burrows into sand during the cold desert nights. It prefers to travel in groups of ten.

drapion,"Drapion are aggressively territorial by nature, relentlessly attacking anyone that encroaches on their land. This has given them rather poor reputations as ""Sand Demons"", as they are known for attacking desert travelers seemingly out of nowhere. In the past, desert caravans feared Drapion far more than they did thieves, keeping Cornn Berries on hand under the belief that they would keep them at bay. It was thought that their scent deterred Drapion and other poisonous creatures found in the desert. Drapion use their tough pincers to tear apart foes; they are powerful enough to turn cars into piles of scrap metal. In addition to their strength, their claws can also inject a fatal venom that leaves victims in excruciating pain before they succumb to it. Their sturdy bodies are a source of pride among the species; while their venom is very powerful, they prefer to defeat foes using only brute force to demonstrate their power. Despite their strength, however, in areas where they are found together, Drapion will usually acquiesce to Hippowdon in territorial disputes.

They are aloof Pokémon, preferring to ignore others as much as possible and only engaging in combat when their lives are in peril. When fighting, however, they are not above using “dirty tactics” to keep themselves alive; they are known for making liberal use of “cheap shots” in battle. But when it does fight, it uses its eerie croaking voice to distract its opponent while stabbing them with its fingers.Croagunk are popular as mascot Pokémon for many teams and cities, notably including Pastoria City, Sinnoh as well as a major Galarian pharmaceutical company.

carnivine,"They use their tentacles to latch onto tree branches, dangling the rest of their bodies below. They remain immobile much of the time, disguising as plants. While waiting, they keep their mouths wide open and drool a sweetly scented saliva that attracts prey towards them. Victims approach expecting fruit or nectar, but instead are met with their jaws, which can shut closed in the blink of an eye. Once Carnivine manage to chomp down on victims, it can take a whole day for them to digest their prey, depending on its size.
They can open their jaws 180º, acting like landing pads of sorts for aerial prey. They tend to dwell in areas with soil that is acidic and nutrient-poor; scientists hypothesize that they evolved to be carnivorous in order to cope with this. Poor soil quality and low levels of sunlight made it difficult for most Grass-type Pokémon to subsist solely on photosynthesis, so Carnivine evolved to consume living prey instead to survive where other Grass-types could not.

Finneon are nocturnal Pokémon, found both in shallow coral reefs and deep ocean waters. During the day, they rest at the surface to bask in sunlight. Their pink tail fin spots and side bands absorb light as they sunbathe. Then when night falls, they travel to deeper waters as their markings begin to glow softly in a mesmerizing pink hue, releasing the gathered energy. In the evening seaside resorts will often lay out food for Finneon schools in order to attract them for visitors. It is believed Finneon emit these array of lights to confuse predators. 
They swim by beating their two tail fins like wings in a Beautifly-like manner. This has earned them the nickname, “The Beautifly of the Sea.” They may leap out of the water when swimming, though this makes them easy targets for aerial predators like Wingull.

They are very inquisitive of people, however, and will approach human travelers with great curiosity. Large numbers of them will congregate around human footprints, attempting to discern where they came from. Snover migrate with the seasons; in the winter, they make their way down chilly mountain slopes, as the cooler weather enables them to dwell at lower altitudes. It is during this time where human contact is most likely; they seem particularly fond of children. Once the weather warms again in the spring, they trek back up to their mountain peaks. Their bodies also grow edible white fruits along the borders of the white and brown areas of their torsos in the spring, described to taste like frozen candy; they are a favorite of Galarian Darumaka. In battle, Snover can summon blizzards that obscure the vision of foes with fog-like flurries of snow. Once their opponents are blinded, they will launch balls of ice at them before they have a chance to retaliate. In particularly harsh weather, these Pokémon will root themselves deep beneath the soil to weather strong winds as well as absorb nutrients and warm water from below, regulating their temperatures.

They live in packs in the wild for approximately five members including lower-class Weavile and Sneasel, and they are good at using their teamwork to hunt down prey. When hunting down Alolan Sandshrew, one will flip it over while the other delivers a fatally devastating blow. Most Weavile live on snowy mountains or forests.
On the other hand, it seems that they have their own language to communicate with one another by making patterns on trees, ice and boulders, having over 500 types of markings for communication purposes.
Weavile are omnivores leaning towards the carnivorous side. They sometimes eat berries but mostly they eat meat. In Alola, Weavile are known to hunt Sandshrew and Vulpix for food. They are also known to prey on Mamoswine.
Despite being described as wicked and callous Pokémon in the human societies, Weavile are loyal companions and will pay their deepest respects to their trainers.

Their magnetic forces are strong enough to lift an adult human strapped into a metal harness. Strangely, Magneton can currently only evolve into Magnezone in natural magnetic fields; scientific attempts to trigger evolution through artificially generated ones have all failed. Because of their shape, many mistake floating Magnezone for UFOs.

They can shove rocks into the holes in their hands; by quickly tightening and expanding their arm muscles, they can launch out these rocks like missiles. This is how they use devastating moves like Rock Wrecker to overpower opponents. Sometimes, they may launch Geodude or Roggenrola camouflaging as boulders, mistaking them for real rocks. Their durable carapaces are capable of withstanding volcanic eruptions. In battle, they will often wait for the foe to strike first, letting the attacks bounce harmlessly off of their bodies before counterattacking with their drills. Rhyperior also use these drills to dig through mountains and cliffs. They can then use the rubble as more ammo for their attacks. If threatened without any rocks available, they are still more than capable of defending themselves. Rhyperior can use their powerful drills to use Horn Drill, for instance, to take down foes. They can also swing their club-like tails at opponents when threatened; their immense weight often makes such blows crippling, if not outright fatal.

Conversely, a single Electivire can also produce enough electricity to power a city if harnessed properly. When excited, Electivire will pound their chests, letting loose showers of sparks and thundering roars. Their power correlates with their heart rate, spiking tremendously during battle.

magmortar,"Magmortar are exclusively found deep within active volcanic craters capable of producing the immense heat they need; a single pair of mates will call a whole crater its own. Their pyrogenetic organs somewhat resemble magma chambers in appearance. 
To defend themselves, Magmortar can launch fireballs reaching temperatures of 3,600°F (2,000°C) from their cannon-like arms. When they do so, the sheer, blistering heat makes them briefly glow a whitish hue; they may even begin to melt their own arms when attacking, though magma will heal them. As this incinerates the opponent to a crisp, however, they rarely use this when hunting prey. Even their breaths are very hot, audibly sizzling when they exhale. These breaths can sear meat within seconds and have been known to start forest fires in drier areas. 
Despite their potential dangers, Magmortar are not a very aggressive species, likely due to having few threats in their volcanic homes; they generally will not attack unless provoked. In some older factories, Magmortar are still used to process raw metals.

They are also skilled at using their powerful jaws to tear apart foes in mid-flight. In battle, these tactics manifest as moves like Sonic Boom and Bug Bite. Yanmega are strong enough to carry adult humans into the air. They use the wings on their tails to keep balanced while flying. Yanmega are extraordinarily swift fliers, capable of nearing the speed of sound when unburdened. They are a territorial species and will defend their homes viciously when threatened.

mamoswine,"Mamoswine have been around since the last major ice age, during which they were thought to have roamed in large herds all around the world. They were a common subject of ancient cave paintings from the era. As the climate warmed, glaciers began to retreat, and their populations began to thin. Mamoswine are now very rare in the wild, found only in areas that are permanently frozen over. 
The species caused much uproar in the scientific community when a specimen found in frozen soil dating back 10,000 years was successfully thawed and, to the world's surprise, woke up dazed but otherwise alive. Scientists already knew that Mamoswine could hibernate for long periods of time and withstand subzero temperatures (thanks to their thick fur and insulating blubber), but the frozen specimen was a testament to their hardiness. Their tusks are made of pure ice, fortunately making the already-rare Pokémon undesirable to poachers. In colder climates, these tusks grow even larger and more impressive.

They can form balls of iron in this manner to hurl at foes.Probopass can also use these units to pester attackers and drive them away; since they can control each of their Mini-Noses individually, they can harass foes from three directions at once (four, if one includes the Probopass themselves) to make up for their own sluggishness.

But the abilities they both possess causes disruptions to people and Pokémon for their sleeping is disturbed from both sweet dreams and worst nightmares. Hunted for their misfortunes, forces the two Pokémon to be forever separated with Darkrai residing on Newmoon Islandand Cresselia residing on Fullmoon Island except for once a year when their abilities are suppressed the Alpha Pokémon Arceus so that both Pokémon can be given a single night together.

shaymin,"In its Sky Form Shaymin is brave and bold, but very friendly and sweet. In its Land Form, Shaymin is very shy and sweet and may follow the people it likes.
",Gratitude Pokémon,grass,0′08″,4.6
arceus,"Arceus demonstrated the ability to open time-space rifts which it can use to summon humans from different points in time, Arceus also turned the player's smartphone into an Arc Phone so it could communicate with the player and send them instructions via messages. After the player's battle with Arceus, Arceus described the physical Pokémon encountered by the player as ""a portion of [itself]"", heavily implying that it is not Arceus' true form but rather an extension of itself.

Its balanced stats surpass Mew's, Celebi's, Jirachi's, Manaphy's, and Victini's. It is also capable of learning Draco Meteor if given the Draco Plate. It can learn nearly every move, excluding ones that require the use of arms or hands. The exception to this is Seismic Toss, although it can be presumed that it can lift its foes with telekinesis. It can be said that Arceus is arguably the most powerful Pokémon considering it's the creator of all Pokémon, has the second highest base stats of any Pokémon (only behind Ultra Necrozma), and its ability to overpower three extremely powerful legendary Pokémon (Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina).

",Alpha Pokémon,normal,10′06″,705.5
victini,"Victini is a very shy and elusive Pokémon. It will often become invisible and only reveals itself to those it trusts. However, being a Fire-type, Victini's temper will flare up if it feels the need to defend its friends. 
",Victory Pokémon,"psychic,fire",1′04″,8.8
snivy,"A calm and intelligent Pokémon, Snivy moves swifly in battle. They'll start to move swifter if they bathe in sunlight for long enough. A Snivy will show it's in bad health when its tail starts drooping.
Snivy will always keep their heads held up high. They are known to refuse orders they consider “unbecoming” or “unworthy;” in fact, Snivy may even persuade other Pokémon to complete tasks they do not want to finish for them. Despite their haughty personalities, however, Snivy are also very calm and intelligent. Though they dislike combat, they will stay collected when attacked and always think before acting. Though their arms are usable, Snivy are more adept at using vines to handle objects.
According to Iris and Cilan in ""Snivy Plays Hard to Catch!"", due to their high intelligence, Snivy have high expectations of their trainers. If a trainer fails to meet them, then Snivy will leave them. Despite their smugness, their calm natures and intelligence make Snivy popular amongst trainers in Unova.
Snivy usually live on treetops and tall grasses in many forests.
",Grass Snake Pokémon,grass,2′00″,17.9
servine,"Servine is a tidy Pokémon that always keeps itself clean, so as not to dirty its leaves, as it uses photosynthesis to absorb energy.
When it comes to attacking opponents, it prefers using sneak-attack.Though they can stand bipedally, Servine usually move around by slithering on their bellies. They defend themselves from foes with surprising agility, slithering swiftly between the legs of enemies to disorient them before lashing out with their vines. Servine are also known to use the shade of the thick foliage in their habitats to their advantage, hiding in the darkness to avoid attacks.
",Grass Snake Pokémon,grass,2′07″,35.3
serperior,"Serperior is a very regal, self-confident Pokémon that is not easily intimidated. It will only use all of its strength if its opponent is not fazed by its fierce and noble glare. When confronted with opponents that prove to be their equals, however, they will let their true power show. Their glares are said to freeze weaker foes dead in their tracks. Even with their haughtiness, the great agility and cleverness of Serperior have made them mainstays in the teams of many Unova trainers. 
",Regal Pokémon,grass,10′10″,138.9
tepig,"Tepig shoots fire from its nostrils, but when it is unhealthy the fire it exhales from its nose becomes black smoke. When it's delighted, it wags its tail rapidly.
Tepig mostly eat berries and roasts them before eating.
",Fire Pig Pokémon,fire,1′08″,21.8
pignite,"Pignite spend much of their time eating; they have internal fires constantly burning in their bellies, so they must eat regularly in order to maintain these flames. Their attacks become stronger as their fires burn hotter. When in danger or upset, Pignite can force their fires to flare up and burn through stored lipids in order to unleash powerful attacks. Their movements also become sharper and more agile as their flames intensify. Pignite are also skilled fighters, particularly when it comes to wrestling. They are close-range brawlers; though capable of shooting flames from a distance, they prefer to attack foes using their limbs or even their whole bodies. When Pignite begin to feel hungry, their internal fires will weaken from lack of fuel. Consequently, they will become sluggish and their attacks will weaken. Letting a Pignite's fire completely die out is extremely dangerous for the Pokémon, possibly even fatal. Because of this, Pignite trainers are advised to always carry around fat-rich snacks in case their Pokémon begin to feel famished.
",Fire Pig Pokémon,"fire,fighting",3′03″,122.4
emboar,"Emboar is a kind and wise warrior Pokémon that cares deeply about its friends and its trainer. Emboar are protective of their friends, often using their large bodies to shield them from harm. Their fiery beards flare up when they feel strong emotions. Their lively personalities and protective tendencies, along with their great skill in combat, have made Emboar popular Pokémon for many Unova trainers. 
",Mega Fire Pig Pokémon,"fire,fighting",5′03″,330.7
oshawott,"Oshawott are mostly mischievous and slightly aggressive. When they feel bored, they will play with their Scalchop, making a ""pound"" sound. Many trainers pick Oshawott at the beginnings of their journeys in Unova based on their cuteness. Though these Pokémon may act tough, they are also quick to cower and flee when situations become too intense for them to handle. 
Oshawott are born with scalchops attached, and simple shells found on beaches will not suffice as substitutes. Scalchops consist primarily of a combination of chitin and calcium carbonate—their composition is nearly identical to that of an Oshawott's claws, which are normally retracted. These Scalchops are also as sharp as blades, and are used to slash at foes and keep them at bay. Oshawott also use scalchops to slice open hard Berries when eating and thick vines when traveling. Because they rely on their scalchops so heavily, Oshawott will guard them with their lives. Their unique weaponry and charming personalities make them a common choice for Unova trainers.
",Sea Otter Pokémon,water,1′08″,13
dewott,"Dewott are often seen with a frown of intense concentration etched on their faces, and they are very serious and strict Pokémon that never neglect their training. They are very avid when it comes to practicing their dual-scalchop attack techniques, and never neglect to care for their scalchops. 
When two Dewott meet, they will engage in a friendly duel in which each will show off their signature techniques, hoping to earn the respect of the other in combat. Dewott tend to live alone, but are not territorial and will allow docile people and Pokémon to wander through without conflict. Even trained Dewott will often prefer to remain alone, particularly when practicing. Despite their solitude, Dewott are very protective of their friends and families and will not hesitate to aid their loved ones if threatened.
Although extremely rarely found in the wild, Dewott are aquatic Pokémon, most likely found near the sea. This Pokémon lives in the water and can only be found in the Unova region.
",Discipline Pokémon,water,2′07″,54
samurott,"Samurott are famous for their valiant natures and fighting prowess. In spite of being a powerful creature that can defeat their opponents in the silence, Samurott are gentle and they mostly silently and dedicatedly root for their trainers. Their skilled fighting techniques have garnered them much respect ​in their coastal habitats; a single glare or roar from a Samurott is often enough to scare off enemies. They will never attack foes weaker than themselves, and they are known to help fend off attackers from smaller or younger Pokémon. Their selflessness natures and fearsome battling abilities have made them very popular among Unovan trainers.
",Formidable Pokémon,water,4′11″,208.6
patrat,"Patrat live in large groups known as “mobs” (or, in some areas, “manors”). They dig complex networks of underground tunnels with many openings to the surface, allowing them to covertly travel nearly anywhere without being exposed to aboveground predators. Each opening of these network will always have a Patrat standing on guard, no matter what time it is. Guard Patrat are intensely alert, sometimes not blinking for minutes. In their attentiveness, however, most Patrat tend to ignore looking behind themselves, and thus are vulnerable to attacks from the rear. Their great peripheral vision makes them quick to notice foes coming from the sides, however. 
Patrat will become anxious when even a single hole is left unguarded, and will refuse to leave their tunnels until an “all-clear” signal is given by every one of the guards. They wave their tails to communicate with others. They are able to store food in their cheek pouches to bring back to their nests; members of a mob will store their food communally in one large pile.
",Scout Pokémon,normal,1′08″,25.6
watchog,"Watchog never blink or close their eyes, even when submerged underwater. Like Patrat, they live in large groups (though these groups are known as “clans” rather than “mobs”). These Pokémon can go for days without sleep and can remain standing completely still for similar periods of time.&#160; Watchog are constantly on the lookout for danger. Members of a clan will arrange themselves so that they can see approaching foes from every angle. When Watchog spot trouble, their tails will stand straight on end and the fluorescent bands on their body along with their eyes will glow, both alerting their allies and unnerving approaching enemies; the initial flash of light has been known to temporarily blind attackers. Their friends will scramble back into their tunnels and shovel as many seeds as they can in their cheek pouches (like Patrat, Watchog keep their food in a communal pile underground), surfacing back up to shoot kernels at the foes. 
",Lookout Pokémon,normal,3′07″,59.5
lillipup,"Though they are adorable, lively and gentle, they are still smart enough to have the choice to decide whether they should leave their trainers and how to battle or socialize. They are known for their bravery, loyalty, intelligence, and adorableness.  
These Pokémon will fearlessly stand their ground when confronted. However, they quickly assess situations to determine risk and are smart enough to back down from foes that are too strong for them to tackle with. They are thought to be smarter than young children, with great memories; they remember the faces of both those who aid or abuse them. 
Lillipup are very loyal and are quick to defend their trainers and allies. Though their senses of smell are above average, they rely more so on their fur to learn about their environments. Lillipup also do not bark frequently and are rather obedient, making them well suited to trainers living in small apartments.
",Puppy Pokémon,normal,1′04″,9
herdier,"Herdier have a docile temperament in general. Although they're not talented at battling, they observe and analyses their opponents calmly before giving them an unexpected attack. Also, they detest evilness and care for their trainers deeply, and they know how to teach their teammates effectively, so they're good choices to be mentors of young Pokémon.They are extremely loyal Pokémon, perhaps even to a fault; Herdier will always obey their trainers’ commands, even if doing so would put them in danger. They are very wary of strangers, however.
On farms, they help herd and defend livestock, while in cities, they are often kept as pets and hailed for their loyalty.
",Loyal Dog Pokémon,normal,2′11″,32.4
stoutland,"Stoutland has been known to rescue stranded humans on snowy mountains. Its thick fur acts as a natural insulator that keeps out the cold; Stoutland doesn't tolerate tropical climates very well since the intense heat makes it much sluggish and uncomfortable. 
Because of its trustworthy and loyal disposition, Stoutland is often used for rescue teams. Even after being caught in the wild, Stoutland will immediately warm up to its human companion within three days. Social standing is determined by the length of a Stoutland's mustache.
",Big-Hearted Pokémon,normal,3′11″,134.5
purrloin,"Purrloin is extremely smart, crafty, and mischievous. It puts on a cute act in order to steal items from people just to see the shocked looks on their faces. When threatened, it will attack with its sharp retractable claws. Sometimes, it tries to show an obscure appearance so as to get the love it wants from its trainer.Many believe Purrloin only steal for fun; unlike Pokémon like Meowth or Murkrow, Purrloin do not hoard what they thieve, and instead toss them away once sufficiently far from their owners.These Pokémon have a rivalry with Nickit in regions where both are found.
",Devious Pokémon,dark,1′04″,22.3
liepard,"Liepard are nocturnal Pokémon. They are excellent hunters, stalking their prey silently at night, and swiftly striking from behind before their victims have a chance to react. They are naturally sly and cunning. They are also very mysterious, seeming to vanish and appear unexpectedly. For example, they use their charm to cheat the opponents in order to heist their belongings. As trainers' rare Pokémon, Liepard love boasting their talents by stunting their trainers. 
In Galar, they compete with Thievul over territories.
",Cruel Pokémon,dark,3′07″,82.7
pansage,"Pansage dwell deep in forests and thick woodlands, especially those in warmer areas. They are friendly Pokémon that often approach strangers; many of them sometimes congregate around travelers. They spend much of their time up in the treetops, though they will wander around the forest floor in search of their favorite food—Berries. Pansage are skilled in locating Berries and are very knowledgeable about their various effects. They are known to share Berries with injured Pokémon and humans, curing ailments like poisoning, paralysis, and burns with the different Berries they have foraged. they will also lead hungry travelers to Berry bushes and thickets where they can find food. The leaves in the small tufts on their heads contain a potent combination of various aromatic compounds that is highly effective at relieving stress and weariness. Pansage may offer one of their leaves to tired travelers after showing them Berry bushes, revitalizing them and allowing them to continue their journeys with renewed vigor.
",Grass Monkey Pokémon,grass,2′00″,23.1
simisage,"Unlike its calmer and mild-mannered pre-evolution, Pansage, Simisage is a wild and savage Pokémon. It is ill-tempered and fights by wildly swinging its thorny tail. 
",Thorn Monkey Pokémon,grass,3′07″,67.2
pansear,"Pansear do not only restrict themselves to active or dormant volcanoes; they can also be found on or near the calderas of extinct ones as well, despite their lack of magma. This ability makes extinct volcanoes ""hot spots"", so to speak, for Pansear colonies; as other species of Pokémon emigrate to new volcanoes once their current ones die out, Pansear in these areas can take over the abandoned territories and repopulate them. Pansear internally combust their food (mostly Berries) to provide themselves with energy. They are highly intelligent, capable of solving logic puzzles as fast as an average child. They mainly store heat in the tufts of fur on their heads, which can reach temperatures of up to 600&#160;°F (300&#160;°C). They often cook gathered Berries before consuming them, and are known to skewer them on twigs and roast them over their heads as they search for more food.
",High Temp Pokémon,fire,2′00″,24.3
simisear,"Simisear is a very hot-tempered Pokémon that is easily angered. It also loves to eat sweets because the sugars fuel the fire blazing inside its belly and helps to provide the Pokémon with sufficient energy for battle. When it becomes distraught, embers rise from its head and tail, which rapidly increase in temperature.
In addition, Simisear are very enthusiastic Pokémon. They will often approach foreigners entering their territories, holding out handfuls of Berries as peace offerings.In artificial settings, Simisear have been shown to be intelligent enough to grow and harvest their own Berries if provided with the necessary tools and instructions. However, they appear to only be willing to farm their own food if no other options are available; they will let their crops wither as soon as a more available food source appears.
",Ember Pokémon,fire,3′03″,61.7
panpour,"Despite being adept swimmers, they spend most of their time on land foraging for Berries. Panpour can store water in the tufts of fur on their heads, allowing them to travel long distances while staying hydrated.&#160; Flexible, hose-like structures run down their backs and through their tails, enabling them to shoot water out of their tails at varying pressures to defend themselves from enemies. In addition to storing water, these tufts also infuse the water they store with nutrients and minerals Panpour obtain from their food. This makes Panpour water very nutritious, particularly for plants. Though Panpour cannot plant their own sources of food (as they seem unable to make the connection between seeds and plants), they are smart enough to learn how to water plants in order to encourage their growth. Plants watered by Panpour grow exceptionally large thanks to the fortified water Panpour spray. In hot weather, Panpour may spray themselves in order to cool down.

munna,"Munna feed on the dreams of people and Pokémon alike. They rest in abandoned buildings during the day, cloaking themselves in soporific Dream Mist as protection. At night, they wander about houses in search of sleeping individuals, siphoning their dreams into the holes on their snouts. Their floral patterns light up as they feed. This process is entirely harmless, though these individuals will wake up unable to remember exactly what they dreamed of.
Once Munna consume what they can of the dreams, they then process the remaining substance into Dream Mist, a sleep-inducing fog that they use to protect themselves from predators. If the dreams they consumed were pleasant, then the Dream Mist will be bright pink in color and dissipate fairly quickly once released. Munna that siphon nightmares, however, will expel thick, grayish-purple or black mist and will likely become ill. Munna will aid those suffering from bad dreams by shrouding them in Dream Mist; inhalation of the mist will replace bad dreams with whatever dreams the Munna had consumed before.
Mostly docile, domesticated Munna usually obey their trainers without any hesitation during battles.
",Dream Eater Pokémon,psychic,2′00″,51.4
musharna,"Musharna sleep through the day, only becoming active in the moonlight. Even then, they seem to float in states of half-consciousness, with their eyes remaining closed as they wander about. They very much dislike being disturbed from their slumbers. Like Munna, Musharna consume the dreams of people and Pokémon through the holes on their forehead. However, their Dream Mist is far more powerful and concentrated than that of Munna. Gazing closely at their Dream Mist will reveal fragments of the dreams the Musharna had consumed. Depending on the dreams eaten, their mists can take a variety colors, though pink is the most common. Dark, sooty Dream Mist is said to be especially dangerous as it makes a person's nightmares to life. When threatened, Musharna can manipulate their Dream Mist to create physical manifestations of the objects, people, and Pokémon within the dreams they had eaten. The figures created are often indistinguishable from real ones.
Being gentle Pokémon, Musharna tend to obey their trainers during battles, but they are also rather timid and are mostly incapable of retaliating against more intimidating and ferocious opponents. They are usually quite oblivious to their surroundings as well, owing to spending most of their time in slumbering. However, their docile temperament has still made them quite adored by many trainers.
",Drowsing Pokémon,psychic,3′07″,133.4
pidove,"Pidove are usually forgetful and unresponsive, but they are also loyal, smart, and love to be with humans. Pidove are not able to understand complex instructions during their training, and may soon forget the instructions the trainer just issued, and will stay in the place waiting for a new command. The impressive thing about Pidove is that they are usually obeying the trainers' instruction, as long as they understand it, and will deftly to complete. Pidove like humans and they often appear in places with a lot of humans to gather together and fly freely, which makes them good partners of humans.
",Tiny Pigeon Pokémon,"normal,flying",1′00″,4.6
tranquill,"Tranquill seem to have very strict requirements and a more serious nature than Pidove, and can rely on their keen intuition and sharp vision to pursue the route, looking for their targets. But Tranquill are also very friendly, so it is not necessary for human to question about their loyalty. Additionally, Tranquill seem to have a spirit of pacifism, which might be a reason why some humans believe that they live in a kingdom full of peace.
",Wild Pigeon Pokémon,"normal,flying",2′00″,33.1
unfezant,"Having an extremely strong self-esteem and arrogance, it hates others to get close to it except its trainer. In addition, it has a great sense of its territory and they will do anything ranging from intimidating to threatening in order to deal with its opponets.
",Proud Pokémon,"normal,flying",3′11″,63.9
blitzle,"Blitzle can be found in small herds of roughly two dozen members on dry plains and savannas. They are especially common during thunderstorms, when large numbers of them congregate out in the open to absorb discharged electricity. The tips of the manes on their heads act as lightning rods, directing lightning to themselves and storing it for later use. Blitzle flash their manes with varying frequencies, rhythms, and intensities to communicate with others. When threatened, they can discharge large amounts of electricity at once in bright flashes of light, giving them time to dash away while foes are blinded. Blitzle have no way of generating their own electricity, however, so they rely largely on the weather to charge up. Because of this, Blitzle rarely use their electricity for anything other than communication unless the situation is absolutely dire. Scientists believe that their black bodies and white stripes help them avoid predators—when many Blitzle stand in a group, it becomes difficult to distinguish one from another due to their blending patterns.
",Electrified Pokémon,electric,2′07″,65.7
zebstrika,"Zebstrika is a wild, ill-tempered Pokémon that is easily angered. When enraged, it blasts powerful bolts of lightning from its mane and runs wild. Like Blitzle, they can be found in herds averaging about 20 or so members. Once a single Zebstrika in a herd charges, the rest of the herd charges as well, leading to a stampede within a matter of seconds. like their pre-evolutions, they communicate by flashing their manes in a variety of patterns, though their stripes can now light up and flash as well. They often attack with little regard for their own safety.
",Thunderbolt Pokémon,electric,5′03″,175.3
roggenrola,"Being compressed underground, Roggenrola's body is as hard as steel. Because its ear is placed in front of it, Roggenrola always wander in the path of the sound that is coming in front of it. However, it has a tendency to panic and topple over if any sound it hears ceases. 
Many of years ago, Roggenrola was discovered during a massive earthquake. It often competes with Geodude and Carbink in a test of body endurance, seeing which species has the sturdiest body. 
Roggenrola's body is as hard as steel and will lose its firmness if exposed to water for a while. If it detects sound, Roggenrola will move. Its inner core gives off heat and is warm enough to be touched.  
",Mantle Pokémon,rock,1′04″,39.7
boldore,"Boldore is always searching for sources of water deep underground. However, because of its dislike of water, Boldore always takes small sips to avoid getting soaked. It moves swiftly from both sides while facing in the same direction. The orange crystals that stick outwards signifies that a Boldore is in perfect health. In addition, the crystals themselves contain so much energy that a single fragment has enough fuel to power up a hundred dump trucks. 
Boldore is able to release powerful bursts of energy from the crystals on its back whenever the crystals themselves start to glow. It uses sound waves to detect its surroundings.  
",Ore Pokémon,rock,2′11″,224.9
gigalith,"Gigalith usually inhabit underground areas. It is able to absorb and contain solar rays within its energy core. The energy stored within Gigalith is released as a strong energy blast. The blast of energy is extremely powerful, which often results in deep gashes forming all over Gigalith's body.
Although it is able to use this ability to obliterate an entire mountain, Gigalith is unable to do so in rainy weather or during the night. The sun beams Gigalith releases from its mouth has enough power to launch a dump truck. 
Because of its immense strength and sturdy body, Gigalith is popular among construction workers.
In the Galar Region, Gigalith is often seen inside mines and on construction sites working alongside with humans and Copperajah. 
As seen in the anime, Gigalith is known to consume rocks as part of its natural diet in the wild.&#160;
",Compressed Pokémon,rock,5′07″,573.2
woobat,"Woobat roost by attaching their noses to the walls of caves, using their nostrils as suction cups. When they fly away, they leave behind distinctive heart-shaped marks on walls. Some people believe that having a Woobat land on one's body and leave a mark on the skin is a sign of good fortune, especially for one's romantic life. Woobat are friendly Pokémon, and curious ones as well. Many of them can be seen flitting around spelunkers that enter their caverns, probing the travelers with their sound waves and noses. During mating season, Woobat engage in complex mating rituals that involve “kissing” noses with each other and flying around in a variety of intricate, interlocking aerial patterns.
",Bat Pokémon,"psychic,flying",1′04″,4.6
swoobat,"Most of the time, these Pokémon use their waves to navigate; however, when threatened, they can instead produce frequencies capable of pulverizing stone and concrete. Releasing such strong sound pulses tires them out quickly, however, rendering them temporarily unable to fly. By shaking their tails vigorously, they can further increase the power of their waves. Despite their destructive potential, however, Swoobat rarely ever need to resort to using such attacks. They are very friendly Pokémon that are almost always found in pairs. Recently, researchers have discovered that the ultrasonic waves emitted by idle male Swoobat while courting (which they are almost always in the process of doing) have a positive effect on the moods of both people and Pokémon.
",Courting Pokémon,"psychic,flying",2′11″,23.1
drilbur,"Drilbur can be found in areas with temperate climates and solid, dry ground. They spend most of their time in underground caves and tunnels, primarily surfacing to supplement their diets with fruits and plant matter (they usually consume insects and other small invertebrates found in the dirt). Despite being mostly solitary, Drilbur tend to be very friendly towards other Pokémon and humans. They sometimes develop mutualistic relationships with people in suburban and rural areas, plowing backyard gardens and orchards in exchange for fruits and Berries. However, unruly Drilbur can easily damage entire fields of crops by tearing carelessly through plant roots, so trained individuals are heavily preferred for agricultural purposes. Drilbur build their nests underground, constructing many tunnels passing through them for travel and ventilation. They leaves distinctive mounds of dirt on the surface directly above their nests to help them find their way back home.
",Mole Pokémon,ground,1′00″,18.7
excadrill,"Excadrill are rather territorial Pokémon, attacking intruders that enter their tunnels on sight. Known as ""Drill Kings,"" they dwell deeper in the earth than Drilbur and constructs longer, more complex networks of tunnels as well. Individuals have been found living more than 300 feet (91 meters) below the earth's surface.
Excadrill intentionally construct maze-like tunnel networks that only they can navigate. Prey that stumble into their tunnels become lost in the labyrinths, allowing Excadrill to easily capture and drag them back to their nest in the hearts of these mazes. The burrowing of these Pokémon is beneficial for crop growth, as they till soil far more efficiently than most human processes. 
",Subterrene Pokémon,"ground,steel",2′04″,89.1
audino,"By touching the feelers on their ears to objects, these Pokémon can pick up even the smallest sound waves; because of this, Audino are common sights in hospitals and Pokémon Centers, where they are trained to use their feelers as stethoscopes to detect irregularities in the heartbeats of patients. Their hearing is so advanced that they can also use their feelers to assess other aspects of an individual's health, including blood pressure, breathing, and digestion. Some Pokémon breeders and daycare centers also employ Audino to assess Pokémon eggs and determine when they will most likely hatch. Even without using their feelers, their hearing is still superb, being as sensitive as many artificial radars. 
Audino are rarely seen in the wild, as they are shy Pokémon that retreat and hide when they hear someone approaching—considering their extraordinary aural abilities, this means that they almost always are hiding from potential enemies. However, they are kind and gentle enough to work with nurses in Pokémon Centers.
",Hearing Pokémon,normal,3′07″,68.3
timburr,"Timburr are common sights in towns and cities, often seen working on construction sites alongside human builders. In the wild, Timburr are usually found in forests and wooded mountains. They use their strength to break down trees into more manageable planks and logs, which they in turn use to construct temporary shelters. Timburr are constantly looking for ways to improve the strength and stability of their homes. Every morning, they tear down the homes they built the day before to salvage materials for constructing new shelters, experimenting with different techniques and designs. This often leads to the creation of very strange-looking shelters, some of which are stable and some of which are not. It is said that these Pokémon enjoy building so much that they throw tantrums when unexpected rain halts their projects for the day. When Timburr are capable of lifting whole logs three times their size without having to splinter them into smaller pieces, they are close to evolution. Wild Timburr are known to visit human cities to examine the architecture of urban buildings; they will later attempt to imitate the designs they see in their own structures.
",Muscular Pokémon,fighting,2′00″,27.6
gurdurr,"Gurdurr uses its steel girder to train its muscles, which it shows off to its comrades, though if it fails to impress them, it keeps a low profile. It also prefers to destroy than build; it is said to excel at demolition and be terrible at construction. Groups of Gurdurr and Machoke can sometimes be seen comparing their muscles with each other; ""losers"" will drop out of future comparisons in favor of additional training.
",Muscular Pokémon,fighting,3′11″,88.2
conkeldurr,"It is believed that Conkeldurr learned how to make concrete long ago in order to construct stronger structures, and taught the skill to humans about 2,000 years ago. Even today, an average Conkeldurr can mix a stronger concrete from natural materials than modern commercial brands. Their upper bodies are so massive that they have trouble staying upright, relying on their concrete pillars to stand up. Despite this, Conkeldurr are incredibly powerful and sturdy. In addition to their strength, they are also very knowledgeable in the fields of building and architecture. These Pokémon are employed at construction sites not to build, but rather to supervise and assess the stability and integrity of structures. In combat, instead of relying on brute force to overpower opponents, Conkeldurr spin their pillars at high speeds and smash them into opponents; the centrifugal force of the pillars enables them to strike with immense power. Conkeldurr can also swing their pillars about freely to attack, though doing so may occasionally cause them to lose balance. In dire situations, they will throw their pillars aside to pummel their foes with their fists, though they have great difficulty remaining upright while doing so.
",Muscular Pokémon,fighting,4′07″,191.8
tympole,"Tympole live in large groups known as “circles.” The growths on either side of their heads can vibrate quickly in order to produce ultrasonic waves. These waves, though imperceptible to humans, are how Tympole communicate with one another. When threatened, a Tympole will emit a distinctive pattern and frequency of sound that only other Tympole can hear; once the rest of the circle hears the warning, they will all begin to produce the same sound. The circle will then, as a group, adjust the frequency of the sound waves they are emitting until they become audible at an earsplitting pitch to attackers. In battle, this tactic manifests as the move Round. Curiously if a single Tympole is isolated and put under stress, it will emit an initial warning sound as usual, but will not attempt to stun the opponent with a subsequent deafening pitch, instead only holding the first note. This seems to indicate that Tympole will not attack until their warning calls are “confirmed” by allies, which occurs when other Tympole replicate the starting pitch. Resonating ripples on the surface of a pond are a sure sign of a Tympole circle singing below.

palpitoad,"Palpitoad live in groups of anywhere from six to twelve members. They cannot stray far from the water's edge, however, as they must keep their skin moist in order to breathe properly (as they essentially breathes through their thin skin). Because they lack arms, Palpitoad rely primarily on their tails for balance. They use their long, sticky tongues to catch flying insects in midair.By vibrating the bumps around their bodies, they can create small tremors on land or ripples in water; this helps scare out prey for them to catch. In the evening during mating season, groups of Palpitoad are often found perched on rocks near the shore. They can be heard executing complex rhythms as a part of their mating rituals by vibrating their circular growths in various patterns. At the end of these songs, the individuals that created the most beautiful rhythms are the most likely to be chosen as mates. Palpitoad with larger bumps can produce a greater range of pitches, thus giving them an advantage in song composition. A few trained Palpitoad have even been able to compose songs aimed to please human listeners.
",Vibration Pokémon,"water,ground",2′07″,37.5
seismitoad,"In terms of ecological niches, however, they fulfill a very similar role to the Poliwag family (though they tend to inhabit muddier, oxygen-poor environments). They are notable for the numerous vibrating organs they have within their bumps, which they use to both communicate and defend themselves. Seismitoad are also infamous for the hallucinogenic toxin they secrete from their skin; while ingestion of Seismitoad toxin was not unheard of prior to the 1960s, it was not until a sensationalist article in a Kalos magazine was published that it became more commonplace (and illegal).Seismitoad are aloof Pokémon. They do not react much to the presence of humans. They almost always fight when they sense danger

",Karate Pokémon,fighting,4′07″,112.4
sewaddle,"Sewaddle makes itself leafy clothes using chewed-up leaves and a thread-like substance it produces from its mouth, though Leavanny tends to make its first set after hatching. By folding it over its face, its leafy hood is used to help hide it from enemies, whether awake or asleep. It has been shown to eat berries, but when food is scarce it will eat its leafy clothing as an alternative.
",Sewing Pokémon,"bug,grass",1′00″,5.5
swadloon,"On its back are the veins of the leaf as well as a bit at the bottom tip of the cloak resembling a rounded tail. Swadloon lives on the forest floor and converts fallen leaves into nourishment, which helps the surrounding plant life grow.
",Leaf-Wrapped Pokémon,"bug,grass",1′08″,16.1

",Nurturing Pokémon,"bug,grass",3′11″,45.2
venipede,"Venipede is a very aggressive Pokémon that will use its venom to paralyze its predators. A voracious predator, Venipede will consume whatever prey it can swallow whole without knowing the outcome. It is said to be a close relative of Skorupi and Sizzlipede; however, once Venipede crosses paths with a Sizzlipede, a huge fight will ensue.

scolipede,"Scolipede is an extremely aggressive and dangerous predatory Pokémon. It will chase and attack its prey relentlessly, using the stinging spines on its neck to poison its victim until it is paralyzed. It will then finish off its prey with a powerful and fatal poison. 
Scolipede will also grab ahold of its prey via neck claws before slamming its victim onto the ground to deliver a lethal dose of poison from its claws. It often engage fights with Centiskorch over territory, with the battle resulting in the loser becoming food for the winner.  
",Megapede Pokémon,"bug,poison",8′02″,442
cottonee,"Cottonee travel very closely in the wind during their mating period, making them appear like a cloud. They are usually very friendly, and people often see them helping each other. However, when attacked, they will shoot cotton from their bodies to serve as a decoy. When it is raining, they will hide underneath trees so their cotton doesn't get wet and weigh them down. People use their cotton to make pillows and furniture, among other things, so they are prized by many luxury brands.
",Cotton Puff Pokémon,"grass,fairy",1′00″,1.3
whimsicott,"Whimsicott is a notorious trickster and a very mischievous Pokémon. It will sneak into houses by slipping through the smallest gaps, and will cause mischief by moving furniture and leaving balls of cotton behind. Despite their fondness for trickery, however, Whimsicott rarely ever mean to intentionally cause harm; in fact, they will actively intervene in their own pranks if they believe that someone will be hurt. 
Whimsicott will constantly grow more cotton as long as they remain exposed to sunlight, and thus must groom themselves regularly by pruning off the excess and scattering it to the wind.
",Windveiled Pokémon,"grass,fairy",2′04″,14.6
petilil,"Petilil favor places with clean soil and water, hence they live in places with nutritious and fertile soil. They have mass migrations whenever their surrounding environment degrades. They love their leaves being pruned regularly and can grow into a fine plump shape. The deeper their leaves, the healthier they are.
Petilil will store extra sugars when in good weather so they won’t go hungry in the event that they shed their leaves to escape from predators. Due to having a timid disposition, Petilil almost always flee at the first sign of danger, and as such rarely pose a threat to humans.
",Bulb Pokémon,grass,1′08″,14.6
lilligant,"Lilligant are popular among celebrities. Nonetheless, it's hard to let the flowers on their heads bloom, because if they get a lack of attention or care, the flower will wither. This shows that Lilligant are extremely delicate Pokémon that require lots of pampering.
However, sometimes even after their trainers have paid all their effort, when a Lilligant finds a beloved mate, the flower withers.
Lilligant mainly live in forests (such as Pinwheel Forest) of Unova and meadows of Alola. Some dwell in the Isle of Armor.  
",Flowering Pokémon,grass,3′07″,35.9
basculin,"Basculin are aggressive, violent Pokémon. Blue and Red Basculin do not get along and often fight. However, on rare occasions, members of one school might mingle with the other's school. Schools of Basculin are almost always made up of individuals of the same form (with a few, rare exceptions), and will viciously attack schools of the other color with their strong jaws. Consequently, most bodies of water where Basculin dwell will have an overwhelming majority of one form, with most individuals of the opposite color having been killed off. They are also generally hostile to other species, albeit not to the same degree as to rival Basculin (and even-more hostile Carvanha). Still, they usually are aggressive enough to drive off all Pokémon other than Corphish and Crawdaunt. Basculin appear to differentiate threats from allies by color; red Basculin will attack anything blue, while blue ones will attack anything red.
White-Striped Basculin have a more calm and gentle demeanor than their red and blue striped forms, but still retain loyalty to their school. Every year, schools of White-Striped Basculin undergo arduous journeys upstream to return to their birthplaces. These journeys involve countless waterfalls and rapids, and many don't survive the voyage. Those that do manage to reach their destinations evolve into Basculegion and mate with females, giving birth to the next generation of White-Striped Basculin. Due to their calmer nature, many people believe them to be a different species altogether. 
In the present, White-Striped Basculin and its evolved form Basculegion can be found in Kitakami.
Bombirdier and Dondozo are their natural predators.
",Hostile Pokémon,water,3′03″,39.7
sandile,"Sandile dwell in arid and sandy deserts. They spend most of their time submerged in the sand, leaving only their nostrils and eyes above the surface. They use their powerful legs and lower bodies to ""swim"" within the dunes. Because Sandile are cold-blooded, they rely on the outside environment to regulate their body temperatures.
During the sweltering heat of the daytime, staying buried in the sand keeps them cool, and also to hide themselves from their prey that they intend to ambush. At night, however, when temperatures drop drastically, these Pokémon rely on the heat retained in the sand from the daytime to stay warm. Sandile also have dark membranes over their eyes; not only do they protect them from blowing sand, but they also shield their eyes from the intense light of the desert sun, absorbing its ultraviolet rays. Though Sandile are predators, desert scarcity and their small stature often leaves them with little choice but scavenging. They are ubiquitous in this role and are sometimes known as the ""cleaners of the desert.""
Sandile are known to be inquisitive towards human travelers, often walking beneath them or tearing holes in their bags to examine their contents. However, they rarely mean any harm, and may even befriend trekkers if they enjoy their presence. Though normally solitary, Sandile seem to instinctively protect others of their kind if they see any of them being threatened. In warm weather, they may occasionally venture out of their desert homes, though this is a rare occurrence.
",Desert Croc Pokémon,"ground,dark",2′04″,33.5
krokorok,"They seek out groups of five to seven members for aid in hunting and protection. These groups are led by females, who delegate hunting to males. They are nocturnal predators, though they are known to wander about during the day as well if they have not eaten for a while. As reptiles, though, they despise the cold, and will bury deep into the desert sand, where the day's heat is retained, on particularly chilly nights instead of hunting.
The black membranes covering their eyes develop a new function upon evolution; not only do they protect them from sandstorms and light though because they are rarely active in the day, this is hardly ever a factor. But they also grant Krokorok with infrared vision. This makes them superb hunters, even in the darkness of desert nights, as they can detect prey by their infrared signatures rather than by sight alone. Using their heat-sensitive eyes to locate unwary victims, packs can easily surround and corner their prey before their targets even notice. They will bury extra food in the sand as an emergency cache in case they fail to hunt down a meal in the future.
Because their masks vaguely resemble those of criminals, Krokorok are often portrayed as malicious in popular culture. In reality, though, Krokorok are not particularly sinister Pokémon despite how they are often depicted.
",Desert Croc Pokémon,"ground,dark",3′03″,73.6
krookodile,"Krookodile is known as the Bully of the Sands. While aggressive by nature, Krookodile is patient enough to bury itself underneath the sand and wait for prey to pass by. Its jaws boasts immense strength and can rip through a large car and heavy iron plates. Once Krookodile latches onto its prey with a jaw lock, it will not let go. Krookodile always cooperate with Flygon during hunts, using Flygon's sand storm as cover to ambush prey. Its eyes can be used as binoculars; Krookodile uses this ability to detect objects and potential prey from afar. 
",Intimidation Pokémon,"ground,dark",4′11″,212.3
darumaka,"Darumaka have an internal fire inside their bodies. When this fire is hot, one becomes hyper, but will fall asleep when the fire itself gets low. When sleeping, they retract their limbs into their bodies, and slightly sway. While they are sleeping, they cannot be tipped over no matter how much they get pushed or pulled, like a tumbler doll, which they resemble in this slumbering state. They are also known to have very warm droppings, which ancient people put in their clothes to keep themselves warm. They normally dwell in deserts. During the day, these Pokémon are extremely hyperactive; the fires burning within their bodies keep them constantly running about. Upon awakening, the creatures appeared dazed for a while, but were otherwise completely healthy. Darumaka subsist on insects, arachnids, and whatever plants they can find in the harsh desert. Darumaka add small mammals onto this list.
",Zen Charm Pokémon,fire,2′00″,82.7
darmanitan,"Darmanitan is a mostly belligerent creature that is capable of generating an internal flame inside its body that burns at 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing it to demolish a single dump truck in a single punch. However, once weakened, Darmanitan will enter its Zen Mode that allows it to sharpen its mental focus to combat opponents with psychokinesis. 
Just after the storms end, they may even play with young children and engage in lighthearted snowball fights. 
In the Galar region during snowstorms, Darmanitan often goes to human homes and stash food inside the snowball on its head and carry them to barren homes. Unlike its Unovan counterpart, Galarian Darmanitan has a timid and friendly demeanor, even disguising itself as an ordinary snowman if any humans are nearby. When it reaches its Zen Mode, Galarian Darmanitan becomes more aggressive and wild after its flame sac has been reignited. It will continue to go on a rampage, spewing flames everywhere even when it is on the brink of melting.
",Blazing Pokémon,fire,4′03″,204.8
maractus,"Maractus usually shake themselves to fend themselves by startling bird Pokémon through their rhythmic dances and body movements, as well as producing a sound similar to a maracas. They scatter their seeds once in a year.
Maractus are commonly found in groups of anywhere from a dozen to two dozen in dry, sandy regions; their most common sightings are in dry and arid areas, such as deserts. They can survive on remarkably little water for Grass-type Pokémon, letting them to tolerate the aridity of barren deserts. Though they are capable of moving, Maractus remain rooted in place for the majority of the day in order to conserve as much energy as possible. When it rains, Maractus will gorge themselves on water to last until the next distant rainfall. 
",Cactus Pokémon,grass,3′03″,61.7
dwebble,"Dwebble often look for solid rocks if they do not already own one as a shell. Once they find a suitable rock, they begin to spit corrosive liquid onto them or dig holes in them to make into their shell. This habit sometimes leads to them attacking Roggenrola or Rolycoly, attempting to make them into its shell. If they are unable to find a suitable home, they may take refuge inside of the ports on Hippowdon where they help dislodge stuck rocks.
",Rock Inn Pokémon,"bug,rock",1′00″,32
crustle,"Crustle are able to survive for long periods of time without water, which is often scarce in their arid habitats. In fact, they dislike direct contact with the substance, retreating beneath their shells during even light rains. To fashion their shells, Crustle will carve blocks of dirt and stone from the solid earth directly beneath their feet. They are highly territorial and will compete with nearby Crustle for control of choice swathes of land. When fighting for territory, Crustle will attempt to shatter the shells of their opponents. Competitors with broken shells relinquish all of their land; they also become timid and weak, as they are unable to defend themselves until they can build new shells. Because Crustle carve their shells from the ground within their domains, Crustle from different areas will often sport rocks with differently-colored strata. Crustle appear to be able to distinguish foreign and native visitors from each other based on these alternately-colored layers. Though they dislike confrontation, their claws are strong enough to crack a Rhyperior's carapace, and they will wield them fiercely if they feel their shells are threatened.
",Stone Home Pokémon,"bug,rock",4′07″,440.9
scraggy,"Scraggy live in small groups. They have a habit of headbutting, and will headbutt anyone who makes eye contact with it. They are even known to greet other Scraggy by headbutting, as a method to test their strength. In order to defend itself, a Scraggy will pull its skin up to its neck. Scraggy with baggier skin garner more respect amongst their peers.
",Shedding Pokémon,"dark,fighting",2′00″,26
scrafty,"Scrafty often form large groups to attack any trespassers that try to invade their territory. The leader of the group always possesses a large head crest. Scrafty can execute powerful kicks capable of smashing through concrete, even those made by Conkeldurr. Despite its tough demeanor, Scrafty can be caring to its friends, family, and turf. Scrafty is able to produce an acidic spit from its mouth.

Galarian Yamask is formed when an ancient clay tablet is drawn to a vengeful spirit. The slab has possessed it and absorbs its dark powers.
",Spirit Pokémon,ghost,1′08″,3.3
cofagrigus,"It is said that anyone that strays too close to a Cofagrigus will be transformed into a mummy. Gold pieces are Cofagrigus's favorite food. Because of its uncanny likeness of a sarcophagus, Cofagrigus has trapped many grave robbers that foolishly tried to steal it. 
Cofagrigus's entire body is made out of gold. Its remembrance of being human is forgotten and has been told by many people to this day. Many ancient tombs have been decorated with Cofagrigus, which also has been a symbol of wealth from many past kings. 
",Coffin Pokémon,ghost,5′07″,168.7
tirtouga,"Though slow and clumsy on land, they nevertheless could beach themselves onto shores in order to capture unsuspecting prey. Indeed, some studies suggest that a sizable portion of their meals came from terrestrial prey. Tirtouga are thought to have gone extinct because they was unable to compete with similar chelonians; although their competitors were slower, they also required less food to survive and reproduce.
",Prototurtle Pokémon,"water,rock",2′04″,36.4
carracosta,"Carracosta is an amphibious Pokémon, spending most of its time underwater and on land. Its front appendages are strongly developed and can knock out opponents in just a single slap as well as ripping a hole underneath a tanker. Carracosta consumes the shell and bones of its prey to fortify its sturdy shell. It hunts prey on dry land despite having slow land mobility.  
",Prototurtle Pokémon,"water,rock",3′11″,178.6
archen,"They dwell in the treetops of warm jungles; despite their wing-like arms, however, Archen are unable to fly. Instead, they hop from branch to branch to get around. 
They are known to be very cowardly; though aggressive at first, they will quickly retreat when threatened. Archen are thought to have gone extinct as more adept fliers evolved and out-competed them for resources. A recent publication has suggested that the connection between Archen and modern avian Pokémon may in fact be false, but the scientific community has yet to reach a consensus on the issue.
",First Bird Pokémon,"rock,flying",1′08″,20.9

trubbish,"Trubbish is formed by a chemical reaction caused by the mixture of garbage bags and industrial waste. Anyone who catches a whiff of Trubbish's stench will be knock out for a week or, rarely, sent to the hospital. Due to its insatiable appetite for garbage, Trubbish often follow people who always litter. 
Even a living room that has been littered with trash can draw in Trubbish. 
In the Alola region Trubbish and its evolution, Garbodor, are known to be prey of Alolan Grimer and Alolan Muk. 
In the Galar region, Trubbish's belches are a delicacy to Galarian Weezing. 
",Trash Bag Pokémon,poison,2′00″,68.3
garbodor,"Garbodor ensnare their foes with their left arms and immobilize them with a strong odor secreted from their mouths. They are able to absorb toxic waste and use it to build their own bodies. 
In addition, Garbodor consume vast amounts of refuse daily. Their bodies contain potent toxins undiscovered by science, developed from the rancid waste they eat; a Garbodor's poisonous cocktail will change daily based on its last meal. They have adapted to consume garbage so efficiently that they do not even have to chew; they simply inhale and swallow trash whole. 
Garbodor and their pre-evolution, Trubbish, are known to be prey of Alolan Grimer and Alolan Muk. In fact, it was revealed that the latter's importation to Alola reduced thir population, but made those that remain stronger than Garbodor who live in other regions.
",Trash Heap Pokémon,poison,6′03″,236.6
zorua,"Zorua are known to be mischievous but timid Pokémon. They are tricksters, possessing the ability to change into the forms of others to surprise and confuse them or to playing tricks for fun. They are able to transform into other Pokémon, as well as humans. When transforming into a human, Zorua usually takes the form of a silent child, though some have a preference for a human form. Luke's Zorua is an example, as she seems to like being in a female human form rather than a male human form. Zorua often have an impish grin on their faces while giggling. They have been known to occasionally replace normally talkative children.
Zorua usually reside in lush forest or rugged mountains with their Zoroark parents. Sometimes Zorua can be found in cities either with trainers, some disguised as Humans or Pokémon.
",Tricky Fox Pokémon,dark,2′04″,27.6
zoroark,"Zoroark are mysterious and sometimes mischievous Pokémon, although they are generally more serious than their pre-evolution Zorua. They are very protective of their homes and their family. They will use illusions to trick enemies and prevent them from entering their lair. They are extremely protective of those it cares about and will go to any lengths to keep them safe, including risking their own lives, and one can hold grudges on those who harm its loved ones. Zoroark will hide their Zorua young in their manes to protect them and carry them around. 
There are stories that say Zoroark punishes those who attempt to catch it by trapping them in an illusion. Some domesticated Zoroark, nonetheless, may instead perform their illusions to ease their lonely trainers' solitude.
",Illusion Fox Pokémon,dark,5′03″,178.8
minccino,"Minccino are obsessed with neatness and cleanliness. They always keep themselves well-groomed and clean, and are constantly dusting and sweeping with their tails. They use their tails to thoroughly dust unclean objects and sweep their habitats, as they prefer to live in a tidy place. They greet one another by rubbing each other with their fluffy tails, which may also be a way of grooming one another. If they meet someone that they dislike, they will sweep dust onto the person's body.
",Chinchilla Pokémon,normal,1′04″,12.8

It can become so entranced by what it is watching that it does not notice that it is being attacked by an opponent.

gothitelle,"Although a naturally gifted fortune teller with tremendous psychic powers, Gothitelle dislike conflicts. Gothitelle are also capable of showing cryptic images of their predictions to onlookers by projecting them onto the empty space surrounding them. They can predict the lifespans of other living creatures, including those of themselves, their friends, and their trainers. As a result, despite their great power, Gothitelle are often seen sad or crying because of what they know is ultimately inevitable for both themselves and their loved ones. It is said that if one ever manages to glimpse their true fate through a Gothitelle, one would go mad from the revelation.
",Astral Body Pokémon,psychic,4′11″,97
solosis,"Solosis have highly developed, spiral-shaped organelles on the left sides of their heads that function like brains. They allow Solosis to wield moderate psychic powers and also enable them to communicate telepathically with others of their kind. They are usually docile; even when directly attacked, they sometimes will not bother retaliating if the blow bounced off of their cell membranes.
",Cell Pokémon,psychic,1′00″,2.2
duosion,"Duosion are still technically a single cell, but because of their arrested development, they sometimes seem to act as two separate beings. This is because they quite literally have two separate “brains”, which are really the spiral-shaped organelles they had as Solosis, which have migrated into their heads from outside prior to mitosis. The two structures often act independently from one another, forcing Duosion to attempt to execute both actions simultaneously. This usually renders their movements jerky and erratic. 
Occasionally, both of their brain-like organelles will have the same thought, often due to experiencing a shared threat or initiating an innate reflex. The psychic powers of Duosion are strongest when this occurs—able to reach over half a mile (0.8 kilometers) away—as both organelles are able to act in unison rather than independently in order to focus their abilities.
",Mitosis Pokémon,psychic,2′00″,17.6
reuniclus,"Reuniclus is able to increase its psychic powers via clasping hands with other Reuniclus. It also uses its psychic abilities to manipulate the large arms that make up its green membrane; these arms possess huge gripping strength that can crush large boulders. 
Although capable of using its psychic powers in battle, Reuniclus prefers to use its large arms to pummel opponents. Its membrane contains a special liquid that supposedly enhances wisdom. However, to a human, the liquid itself is highly toxic to consume. 
",Multiplying Pokémon,psychic,3′03″,44.3
ducklett,"Ducklett inhabit slightly acidic ponds, though they can also sometimes be found splashing around in large puddles. Their favorite food is peat moss, which is abundant in their habitats. Ducklett never leave their mothers’ sides, walking behind them in single-file lines with their siblings. Ducklett are excellent divers. They will spend long periods of time completely submerged as they search for food. Ducklett are poor fliers, however, so they rarely take to the air, even when endangered.
If attacked in the water, Ducklett will splash about wildly to distract opponents as they escape. The splashing also alerts their mothers and siblings of approaching danger. Ducklett store water in flexible sacs within their bodies; on land, they can then spray this stored water from specialized feathers on their wings at the eyes of foes, briefly obscuring their vision as they frantically waddle away. Their distressed quacking will signal to their siblings to aid them in spraying more water as well, potentially blinding threats from all possible angles.
",Water Bird Pokémon,"water,flying",1′08″,12.1

It appears to be very physically powerful as it delivers forceful pecks from its beak.

vanillite,"Vanillite is theorized to be created from icicles that absorb the rays of a morning sun. They don't tolerate living in hot areas and will maintain their cold body temperature via creating snow with icy breaths that can reach negative 58 degrees Fahrenheit. Vanillite will seek shelter by hiding underneath snow, mostly whenever they need to sleep. In hotter regions, they are treasured by households, though they shrink little by little. Glalie is a natural predator of Vanillite. 
",Fresh Snow Pokémon,ice,1′04″,12.6
vanillish,"Vanillish live in southern, snowy mountains, which they had migrated to during an ancient ice age. They create ice inside their bodies by drinking water and then expel it to hide or freeze opponents, and they can shatter frozen opponents with powerful headbutts as well. 
Vanillish are smaller in hotter regions, and though one can refreeze its snow despite melting, this process can leave its appearance warped. Despite this, they are very popular in the tropics due to their air-chilling abilities. Trainers in regions like Alola must treat their Vanillish periodically with insulating spray to keep them cold. Such individuals also tend to be smaller than those found in polar areas. 
Though once widespread during a past ice age, areas suitable for Vanillish and their relatives shrank and became isolated from each other during a warming period, separated by bands of warmer temperatures that they could not cross. Today, they can only be found in the icy parts of the southern hemisphere and a select few other chilly areas. 
Despite their powerful ability to freeze their foes solid, Vanillish are surprisingly kind Pokémon. They dislike violence and prefer to immobilize attackers just long enough for them to flee without harming them any further.
",Icy Snow Pokémon,ice,3′07″,90.4
vanilluxe,"This Pokémon consume large quantities of water, which they store inside their bodies and create internal snow clouds. When angered, they will spew out the snow clouds and blast violent blizzards at their opponents. 
Unlike their pre-evolutions, Vanilluxe appear to be more unstable and moody, despite the grins on their faces, often having infighting between the 2 heads. In fact, when their anger reaches a breaking point, they will mercilessly blast out powerful blizzards regardless of them hitting either friend or foe.
",Snowstorm Pokémon,ice,4′03″,126.8
deerling,"Deerling are found primarily in montane forests, though they are known to venture into lowland areas from time to time as well. They are herbivorous Pokémon that graze on low-growing vegetation. They are also very timid, hiding in tall grass at the slightest indication of danger. They are hibernators, as shown in Pokémon Pocket Comics: Black &amp; White (Originally ポケモンBW 爆笑4コマまんが全集; Pokémon Black &amp; White Laughter 4Koma Comic Compilation). Despite their innocent and adorable appearance, Deerling are considered pests by farmers, as they tend to eat all of their plant shoots. Lycanroc is a natural enemy of Deerling; farmers often use them to guard their fields.
",Season Pokémon,"normal,grass",2′00″,43
sawsbuck,"Sawsbuck live in herds in forests. Their most striking features are their antlers, which host a variety of different plants throughout the year. These plants obtain nutrients from the vegetation Sawsbuck eat, and in turn provide them with camouflage to hide in the surrounding environments. In spring, the flowers budding on their antlers match those growing around them.
Sawsbuck herds are led by the individuals with the largest antlers and most beautiful plants growing on them. These Pokémon migrate to different areas each season; because of this, people often refer to them as the “harbingers of spring,” because they return to their initial habitats once spring comes around again. Like Deerling, people often use the antlers of Sawsbuck to determine the season.
In Paldea, Spring Form Sawsbuck is said to many flowers on its antlers will grow at a slightly slower pace because the flowers absorb the Pokémon’s nutrients. The paler the pink flowers that bloom on its antlers, the more beautiful Spring Form Sawsbuck is considered to be.
Summer Form Sawsbuck are said, the thicker and larger the branches and leaves on its antlers, the more majestic it is thought to be. The leaves can be made into a black tea which has a different taste depending on the region, Paldea's is especially aromatic. 
Autumn Form Sawsbuck are said to have short tempers, and the males notably fight each other incessantly. The darker the Autumn Form's red foliage is, the more stylish it is considered. 
Winter Form Sawsbuck are said to be the least popular, but are calmer and easier to tame during the winter. Hence, it is considered the perfect time to obtain one as a partner.",Season Pokémon,"normal,grass",6′03″,203.9
emolga,"Emolga is able to glide through the air by using its cape-like membrane, which stores electrical energy. It also releases the electricity from its membrane in order to electrocute opponents, as well as repelling bird Pokémon away from its stash of food. 
In the Alola region, Emolga has been known to inhabit tree holes excavated by Pikipek.

karrablast,"Karrablast dwell in wetlands where Shelmet can also be found, though they may also wander into grassy fields. They are very territorial, butting heads with other Karrablast using the horns on their head to compete for space. Karrablast can spit a mildly corrosive acid from their mouths to deter predators. This acid rarely has a lasting impact on larger foes, however (unless it makes contact with the eyes or other vulnerable locations), so Karrablast often choose to hide in trees or grasses instead to avoid detection.
These Pokémon feed on soft-bodied mollusks, dissolving their vulnerable insides with acid while leaving their shells intact. They spend much of their time searching for Shelmet to facilitate their evolutions. When they find them, Karrablast will use their horns to pry the Shelmet out of their shells, which they steal for themselves. With some sort of electrical stimulus, such as a trade, both Pokémon can then evolve. In the wild, competition for Shelmet can be fierce between Karrablast, who will invade each other's territories and spar with rivals for Shelmet. Shelmet have been known to use this time to sneak away from the danger.

jellicent,"According to legends, Jellicent are territorial, they seem to capture, and consume anything that enters their territories (including ships), by dragging them down into the depths of the ocean. These Pokémon mate for life and tend to be social amongst others of their kind. Swarms of Jellicent are often found in ocean trenches and abysses. When night falls, Jellicent venture to the ocean's surface to feed.They tend to be found more frequently near cruise ships and tankers full of passengers. Jellicent feed on life force, leaving victims as empty husks that sink down into the ocean depths. They even seem to congregate at the ocean's surface on nights of the full moon, when ships are most plentiful. Their crowns are thought to grow larger the more life force they consume. It is said that on the ocean floor lies a Jellicent castle made of sunken shipwrecks. Superstitious sailors purport that this castle is an attempt by Jellicent, believed to be the souls of people lost at sea, to reclaim their old lives in an undersea civilization.

alomomola,"Alomomola is a serene, and very loving and caring Pokémon. If it spots an injured Pokémon in the water, it will gently hold the creature in its fins and use its special healing membrane to heal its wounds and revive it. After healing the injured Pokémon, it will carry it back to shore.Alomomola are oddly immune to many common poisons, including that of marine Pokémon like Frillish and Tentacool. Alomomola in fact primarily prey on these species, which most other Pokémon avoid due to their incapacitating toxins.Alomomola enjoy “sunbathing,” lying down horizontally just beneath the surface.  
",Caring Pokémon,water,3′11″,69.7
joltik,"Joltik is often considered too small to create its own electricity, so it preys on Electric-type Pokémon and drains them of their electricity instead. They are also known to infest houses and feed off the electricity produced by wires or indoor appliances. Without electricity, Joltik often stand still or rest until they are able to find another source of power.
",Attaching Pokémon,"bug,electric",0′04″,1.3
galvantula,"Galvantula live within forests and caves in large swarms known as “clusters.” The borders of a Galvantula cluster's territory is clearly marked by a netting of electrified webs that deters foes from approaching.They will lay down stunning webs near the nests of avian Pokémon to catch chicks that are still poor at flying. As a secondary measure, these Pokémon have very strong mandibles and are capable of pinning down struggling foes until they succumb to paralysis in their silk prisons. Additionally, they can even fire charged bristles from their abdomens to paralyze fleeing prey, leaving them stunned for up to three days. After taking down prey, Galvantula will then proceed to consume their meals over the course of a few days. Despite their menacing appearances, Galvantula are not aggressive Pokémon. They tend to ignore anything that they do not consider prey, including humans. However, Galvantula are fiercely protective of their clusters; angering a single individual in a group will cause the entire swarm to attack the aggressor.
",EleSpider Pokémon,"bug,electric",2′07″,31.5
ferroseed,"Ferroseed are one of the main hazards that spelunkers face when exploring mineral-rich caverns. These heavy Pokémon can be found stuck to the walls and ceilings of caves, absorbing minerals through their spikes. When they have finished draining one location of nutrients, they will roll (on walls) or drop down (from ceilings) to new locations—hikers must constantly be aware of what is above them, since Ferroseed can and will drop without any notice; in Chargestone Cave of the Unova region, injuries from falling Ferroseed actually are the most common cause of harm.
Though unintentionally dangerous, Ferroseed are actually rather docile Pokémon. They won't attack unless attacked first, and even when faced an aggressor, the most a Ferroseed will do is release a burst of spikes being rolling away to safety. Their aim is quite poor without practice, however. Though their spikes make them very poor movers, Ferroseed can actually spin in place quickly by balancing themselves on the point of a single spike like a top. They have been known to lodge themselves into rocks in this manner. Recently, scientists have discovered that Ferrossed not only absorb minerals from stone through their spikes, but also vital nutrients from the moss that covers cave walls and ceilings.
",Thorn Seed Pokémon,"grass,steel",2′00″,41.4
ferrothorn,"Ferrothorn dwell in mineral-rich caves, using their three spike-tipped feelers to cling to cavern ceilings and floors. To hunt, these creatures hang idly from the tops of caves, waiting for unsuspecting victims to pass underneath. When they come along, Ferrothorn fire barrages of spikes to subdue them before dropping down below to claim their meals. Ferrothorn will also scrape away at cavern walls to siphon exposed minerals and ores using their spikes. Their feelers are deceptively strong, capable of supporting their weight and allowing them to “stand” upright on the ground. In this stance, Ferrothorn can swing their feelers like flails to attack foes. The tips of these feelers are strong enough to pulverize stone.
Their hard, spiked bodies protect them from most attackers; however, they are also very sensitive to heat. Ferrothorn will seek shelter in the damp recesses of their caverns if they feel the air warming. Excessively heat can cause their normally-sturdy bodies to soften slightly, rendering them vulnerable to further attacks. Spelunkers in Unova's Chargestone Cave are advised to use torches instead of lamps in order to scare off wild Ferrothorn.

In the anime, Klinklang is shown to be used by humans for powering up machinery, such as helicopters.   
",Gear Pokémon,steel,2′00″,178.6
tynamo,"Tynamo live in large schools. Though technically amphibious, these Pokémon can live their lives either entirely on water, on land, or both with no ill effects. These Pokémon tend to congregate in damper areas where they can easily access water to keep themselves hydrated, and find strength in numbers; while individually weak, many Tynamo emitting their shocks together can create jolts as strong as bolts of lightning. When threatened, a school of Tynamo will ball tightly together so that any foes that attempt to attack will be met with discharged electricity from the entire group. 
In some regions, the tiny shocks of electricity from a lone Tynamo were traditionally used to numb small regions of the body prior to invasive medical operations.
",EleFish Pokémon,electric,0′08″,0.7
eelektrik,"Eeletrik dwell either in marine waters or damp caves where they do not run the risk of being dried out by the sunlight. These serpentine Pokémon slither about in the water and in the air in constant search of food. The spots that run down the lengths of their bodies can also release electricity in short bursts. When they come across suitable prey, Eelektric will rush at their victims and quickly coil their bodies around them, paralyzing them with electricity to prevent their escape. Eelektrik will begin searching for another meal immediately after eating, as they are voracious eaters. 
If unable to find small prey for long periods of time, these species will even go after larger, slow-moving Pokémon such as Alomomola or even Wailord. Instead of constricting and shocking them, however, Eelektrik will dart in and sink their teeth into their sides, tearing out circular holes of flesh and swimming away before the larger Pokémon are able to react. Such Eelektrik attacks can leave distinctive round scars on their victims.
",EleFish Pokémon,electric,3′11″,48.5
eelektross,"They serve as apex predators, both in and out of the water. Eelektross use their sucker-like mouths to draw in smaller prey and swallow them whole. To subdue larger victims, they latch onto them with their teeth and let loose powerful electric shocks. Capable of both levitating and waddling on land with their flippers, Eelektross will ambush unsuspecting prey on the shore. They will grab victims with their arms before sinking in their fangs, electrocuting them, and dragging them into the sea. 
These Pokémon are territorial, claiming large swathes of shoreline as their own. They engage in displays of dominance using the crest-like fins on their heads to assert themselves. Notably, both male and female Eelektross engage in this behavior, unlike in most species where only the males do so.

They seem to be highly inquisitive about novel objects, examining and playing with them using their psychokinetic powers. Though not inherently aggressive, Elgyem will use their powerful psychic abilities to give foes crippling headaches when threatened. Those afflicted often wake up with no memory of what had occurred. It is said that when Elgyem pass by media devices, the electronics will begin to display an image of their true home—though it is unlikely that anyone who sees the image will remember it for very long.

",Tusk Pokémon,dragon,2′00″,39.7
fraxure,"Since Fraxure's tusks do not grow back when broken, this Pokémon diligently sharpens its tusks on river rocks after a fight. Fraxure are very territorial and can become particularly violent when protecting their territory from other Fraxure, a fight between two Fraxure over land can be very gruesome, as neither will back down until the other is either maimed or without a tusk. 
These Pokémon will become anxious if they are not able to sharpen their tusks; they sometimes will even forgot searching for food in favor of looking for suitable stones to whet their tusks on. If one tusk breaks off in combat, the Fraxure will be rendered handicapped, not only in battle but in simple movement, as the tusks also provides these Pokèmon with balance.

cubchoo,"A Cubchoo's nose is always running; when they sniff the snot back up into their noses, the mucus provides them with the energy they need to use their Ice-type attacks in battle. They sometimes smear their snots onto people it dislikes. When this Pokémon is sick, the mucus becomes watery, causing the power of their moves to decrease. Thus, trainers can easily discern the health of their Cubchoo based on the viscosity of their substance; thick and sticky snot that holds together well indicates healthy Cubchoo, while thin and runny snot indicates ill ones.
",Chill Pokémon,ice,1′08″,18.7
beartic,"Like Ursaring, Beartic&#160;is highly protective of its young, Cubchoo. When traveling they often give their offspring a ride.They spend most of their time on four limbs, though they will stand bipedally in order to intimidate foes or reach higher ground.
Beartic are capable of exhaling air at subzero temperatures, freezing the surrounding moisture. They use this ability to encase their paws and mouths with claws and fangs of ice, respectively, to attack foes. To cross large stretches of ocean, these Pokémon will freeze the waters beneath their paws, creating pathways of ice for them to walk on. They are also adept swimmers that spend much of their time hunting in the water; when tired, they will simply freeze the water beneath them to rest, creating new ice floes. With their thick fur and wide paws, Beartic are adapted to moving and living in icy environments.
They are often the focus of studies regarding changes in global temperatures because of how heavily they depend on large expanses of ice. A warming climate has caused many scientists to focus closely on the Beartic population, which has been slowly but steadily dropping every year.

Karrablast are the main “predators” of Shelmet, if one could call them that.Shelmet tend to be very cautious and aversive towards novel stimuli, however, so they will often attempt to flee from Karrablast despite needing them for evolution. To deter attackers, Shelmet can spit a sticky, poisonous substance that adheres to and irritates skin upon contact. They will then close their shells to protect their vulnerable bodies from damage. These Pokémon can sometimes be found buried beneath the mud to avoid aggressors.
",Snail Pokémon,bug,1′04″,17
accelgor,"This Pokémon prefers cool and damp habitats such as bogs and swamps.These Pokémon need to keep moist to prevent their skin from drying out. To facilitate this, Accelgor wrap their bodies in mucus-soaked membranes that help them stay moisturized.

Pawniard will, when not hunting, sleeping or eating, constantly sharpen their blades, polish their armor, and generally keep themselves in good condition, because their exoskeleton is their only natural defense. To maintain their cutting edges, they use river stones to sharpen their blades. Each Pawniard has their own preferred stones for honing their blades.

After a Bisharp becomes leader, it will closely monitor and inspect every Pawniard in its pack so that none of its Pawniard dare to betray it. Groups that are defeated in territorial disputes will be absorbed to the packs of the winning Bisharp. However, no matter how strong a Bisharp is, it will have to forcibly retire if its head blade is chipped.
The alpha Bisharp will always take command of a pack of Pawniard to track down and subdue prey before finishing it off without mercy.
In the Galar region, Bisharp and Fraxure are sworn enemies of each other, as they conflict over sharpening stones whenever they find one in their territories.
In the Paldea region, Bisharp are terrified of Tinkatuff, as the Pokémon is somehow able to overwhelm them despite their small size, who then proceed to use their blades for their own hammer.

Protected by its afro, which absorbs damage, its headbutts are strong enough to derail a train and send it flying. It can also destroy a car with just a Headbutt. The more hair a Bouffalant has on its head, the higher positions it has in the herd. A herd of Bouffalant consists of 20 individuals.

vullaby,"Vullaby live in harsh badlands that few other Pokémon can be found in. They cannot fly because their wings are small and underdeveloped. Consequently, they have to resort to other methods of protection; their mothers will gather the skulls of deceased Pokémon for them to use as protection, using larger ones as they grow. Siblings will squabble with one another for comfy bones. Partially due to their voracious appetites, Vullaby undergo multiple growth spurts and require new bones each time, with the old ones being passed on to younger chicks. The bones also protect their rears, as these Pokémon are clumsy and often fall while waddling around. However, they are also heavy, so when Vullaby near evolution and prepare to fly, they will discard their skulls. 
Vullaby are not picky eaters and will consume whatever their mothers bring back to them or wanders close enough for them to chase. Vullaby also almost always try to pursue prey weaker than themselves, sometimes purely for enjoyment; they quickly will give up chase, however. They do not enjoy walking much, so they will only finish hunting down prey when food is scarce. Despite this, they can often be seen hopping excitedly as they try in vain to take flight.

When they find food, they will circle around their victims before diving in. Mandibuzz then carry their prey back to their nests. These Pokémon have an affinity for bones, which they collect to decorate their own bodies as well as build their meticulously crafted nests—ominous-looking piles of bones in badlands are almost invariably abandoned Mandibuzz nests. Many of these bones will invariably be those of Cubone and Marowak, due to their shared penchant for bone-collecting. They will root through carcasses already picked clean of flesh by other scavengers for desirable bones. These Pokémon are often regarded as omens of death in popular culture; the sight of a Mandibuzz circling overhead in a barren wasteland is a harrowing symbol for tired travelers, indicating that the end is near. 
Despite their opportunistic natures, these Pokémon are quite maternal and will adopt orphaned Vullaby from other mothers and raise them as their own. Mandibuzz were one thought to adorn bones to attract mates, but it is now it is more commonly believed that they serve simply as protection. Still, populations of Mandibuzz do seem to observe some form of ""fashion trends"" when it comes to bones, with different types and methods of adornment falling in and out of style over time.

In warm regions, Volcarona is seen as an unwelcomed Pokémon because of the intense heat it produces. However, colder regions often see Volcarona as a blessing because of its status as ""the embodiment of the sun"".

However, such tales always reveal in some way or another that Virizion truly does care about its companions, but simply does not enjoy expressing it. When Keldeo joins the group in most versions of the myth, Virizion is at first the most hesitant about the new member, but eventually grows closer to the protégé.

These Pokémon would rather starve than take food from another hungry creature. 
Quilladin live in small groups of about six or so individuals. Members of a group tend to be very close to one another.

",Fox Pokémon,fire,1′04″,20.7
braixen,"Once a Fennekin evolves into Braixen, it no longer eats branches for snacks, but will still keep a tree branch in its tail in order to fight with. Braixen will occasionally wield the branch in battle and use friction to light it on fire, as if it is a wand.
These twigs appear to function as security blankets of sorts for Braixen, helping temper the mood swings they experienced as Fennekin. If a Braixen loses its stick, it will become fretful, anxious, and even angry, going as far as refusing to accept a replacement. Braixen will also use their twigs to communicate with others, which is useful considering these Pokémon are nocturnal. Sticking the twigs back in their flame-resistant tails will put out the flame through oxygen deprivation.
",Fox Pokémon,fire,3′03″,32
delphox,"Trainers are often struck by the considerable changes in personality their Fennekin have undergone once they become Delphox. While Fennekin tend to be temperamental and moody, Delphox are remarkably calm and collected. They retain their dedication to their trainers and drive to perform well that they had as Fennekin, however. Delphox carry wand-like sticks that they can ignite with psychic energy. When not in use, they store these sticks within the tufts of fur on their wrists. Delphox can stare at the fire at the tips of their branches to achieve a heightened state of focus and glance into the future. They can further focus their psychic energy on these flames to utilize the technique Mystical Fire or create flaming vortexes reaching 5,400&#160;°F (3,000&#160;°C), entrapping and incinerating foes within.

greninja,"A Greninja moves with the speed and grace of a ninja. They use swift movements to confuse their enemies while they slice them up with throwing stars made of compressed water. These throwing stars are sharp enough to split metal.
Greninja can sometimes be found hanging upside-down from tree branches or ceilings in the shadows, waiting for unwary foes to approach. They can propel themselves considerable distances by shooting jets of water at the ground beneath them (though they can often jump just as high, if not higher). Their blinding speed and incredible stealth have made Greninja popular starter Pokémon in the Kalos region for years.

bunnelby,"Bunnelby are energetic and industrious Pokémon. They use their large ears to dig burrows, shovel dirt, and chop trees. They will dig the whole night through. They will sometimes dig superfluous tunnels around their burrows as practice to strengthen their ears. These destination-less tunnels also serve to confuse predators that enter their burrows.
Particularly hardworking Bunnelby have been known to develop ears strong enough to pulverize stone. Bunnelby primarily feed on the roots of plants that they come across while digging; they will even eat through the hardier roots of trees, using their ears to break the tough roots up into more manageable pieces. Bunnelby also have very sensitive hearing, allowing them to detect predators like Talonflame and Corviknight approaching.

litleo,"Litleo are reckless and hot-blooded creatures that are quick to fight and full of curiosity. They mostly live in prides, but when an individual is old enough to hunt down their own prey, they will be kicked out and forced to live on their own.
The intensity and temperature of light emanating from a Litleo’s mane is indicative of its emotions; the mane will burn hotter and brighter when it is angered or excited, but duller when it is ill or fatigued. Litleo manes tend to glow very bright when their owners are in heated battles as their bodies work to provide as much energy as possible.when evolved, they may return to their old prides, join separate ones, or, if male, start their own, provided that they can recruit a respectable numbers of females into them.

Male Pyroars are typically lazy, but will fiercely defend their allies from stronger foes. When hunting for food, Pyroar prefer to eat its prey raw rather than cooking it with a flame breath. 
Female Pyroars often do all of the hunting, using teamwork to take down large prey; this tactic ensures the entire pride has enough food for sustenance.

It never forgives people who attempt damaging flowerbeds.While human urbanization has caused such areas to diminish, the construction of artificial gardens and flowerbeds have given Floette new places to dwell in. In return for the energy Floette pull out of flowers, they spend much of their time tending to nearby plants. They invest most of their energy into ensuring that all of the flowers around them bloom; when they come across a wilting flower, they will do everything in their power to restore its vibrancy. These Pokémon are popular in gardens for this reason, where they can be seen caring for planted flowers. It is said that Floette can draw the most strength from flowers that are the most beautiful.

However, when it gets stroked on the head, it will suddenly show a face full of joy and kindness.

Although that it may get mad easily, its strong heart and defensive to the weak nature is what shapes its personality greatly. To tell the truth, Pangoro is way more fond protecting the weak especially against menacing Dark-type&#160;Pokémon.
Pangoro uses its bamboo leaf to detect movement nearby. It boasts tremendous strength and can reduce a large truck to scrap with just a single punch. In the Galar region, Pangoro often have duels with Obstagoon. 
",Daunting Pokémon,"fighting,dark",6′11″,299.8

Leaving Furfrou's style untended for 5 days or putting it in the PC will cause its fur to grow long and shaggy again, returning to its original look. To maintain the style of its coat, it must be groomed regularly. Styles of coat available include Heart, Star, and Diamond available from the beginning, La Reine, Pharaoh, and Kabuki after earning 10 style points; and Dandy, Debutante, and Matron after earning 50 style points.

",Poodle Pokémon,normal,3′11″,61.7
espurr,"Espurr is a rather self-restraining or someone could say as, ""too empathetic"" to let itself be bothered with others. The reason why it always shut its ears is so that it could control its psychic powers. It is most of the time a loner. It is also fairly independent and prefers to move on its own pace.
",Restraint Pokémon,psychic,1′00″,7.7
meowstic,"Meowstic are very calm and stoic Pokémon as they seldom show their emotions towards their trainers. Also, they sometimes use their psychic to float in the air or protect themselves when they are in danger. However, they will lose control of their power if they are too angry. 
Unlike their pre-evolution Espurr, Meowstic can control their power more easily. The energy is most concentrated in the eyeball patterns on their ears, which they keep closed because the power is too hard to control.
Both genders of Meowstic appear to have different temperament: while the majority of males are more calm, defensive and protective but will also altruistically protect their companions, most females are rather cold, callous and capricious to the degree of selfishly and aggressively punishing others with their psychic powers if they don't get what they want or are angered. Despite this unfriendliness, it is part of their charm.
",Constraint Pokémon,psychic,2′00″,18.7
honedge,"It is said that Honedge is actually a wandering spirit living inside a normal sword. Honedge does not like to be touched, and will not hesitate to use its Ghost-type powers to attack and drain the energy from anyone who disturbs it. If one were to carelessly take Honedge by the hilt, they may find the blue cloth wrapping around their arm, draining the energy from their body.
Legends tell the story of how Honedge's life essence is actually the body of a human who was killed by the same exact sword that comprised of Honedge's body itself. 
",Sword Pokémon,"steel,ghost",2′07″,4.4
doublade,"When Honedge evolves, it splits into the two swords that form Doublade. It is able to rub its dual blades together to create a high pitched sound that can disorient foes. The two swords converse telepathically and can carry out complicated attacks together. These attacks are very difficult for an experienced swordsman to block and can quickly rend an opponent to shreds. 
",Sword Pokémon,"steel,ghost",2′07″,9.9
aegislash,"According to the Pokédex, Aegislash was used as a protector of Kalosian nobility. It uses its spectral powers to control the thoughts and actions of people or Pokémon. It is also able to detect the innate qualities of leadership and whoever it recognizes is destined to be a king. Hence, Aegislash has long been seen as a symbol of royalty. Trained Aegislash seem to only respect trainers who display signs of leadership themselves.
While in Blade Form, Aegislash is able to slice through its opponents with its powerful blade-like body. While in Shield Form, Aegislash uses its steel body and a force field made out of spectral energy to protect itself against incoming attacks. 
Despite its status as a royalty protector, Aegislash can be very unpredictable and manipulative. An Aegislash once served a king, but then decided to drain him of his life-force, thus causing the king's kingdom to fall apart. This Pokémon has even used its spectral powers to force humans and Pokémon to build a kingdom of its liking.

spritzee,"Spritzee likes to spray its fragrance around, which sometimes annoys other people. Spritzee flutter around dense woodlands, feeding on a variety of foodstuffs. While their main diets consists of plant products like Berries, seeds, and flower nectar, they will also eat insects regularly and even scavenge rotting carrion; small flocks of these Pokémon have been known to reduce whole bodies to piles of bones in single feeding sessions.

",Cotton Candy Pokémon,fairy,1′04″,7.7
slurpuff,"Slurpuff is always sniffing around because it possesses an incredible sense of smell. It specializes in detecting sweet smells, and is incredibly fond of visiting bakeries and candy shops.

",Meringue Pokémon,fairy,2′07″,11
inkay,"When in battle, Inkay uses the luminescent yellow patches on its pink cap to hypnotize its foes. When swimming, they swim on their backs and are also able to jump from the water while doing so. It is believed that Inkay will flash their lights in complex patterns to communicate with one another across distances. Curiously, these Pokémon have a habit of turning themselves upside-down for no apparent reason; some believe this action strengthens their abilities.
",Revolving Pokémon,"dark,psychic",1′04″,7.7
malamar,"Malamar use the flashing lights like an anglerfish to lure prey in and ensnare them before eating the prey. They are in fact masters of manipulation, because of their ability that enables them manipulate those who see them into doing their bidding.
In civilized society, their powers pose far more sinister applications; there have been confirmed cases of Malamar controlling people serving as judges, police officers, and high-ranking officials in criminal groups—most notably Team Plasma. A number of conspiracists even hypothesize that Malamar control a number of world leaders as well, in the same vein as Aegislash were purported to in medieval times. Some even go as far as to claim that Malamar are behind every current celebrity in the world.
",Overturning Pokémon,"dark,psychic",4′11″,103.6
binacle,"Binacle seems to be an ill-tempered Pokémon, like Dodrio. Their two heads sometimes quarrel, and often a head will move to a different rock when fights break out. When threatened, Binacle contract themselves and hide the vulnerable portions of their bodies, exposing only their bare heads and sharp claws.
",Two-Handed Pokémon,"rock,water",1′08″,68.3
barbaracle,"All the heads of a Barbaracle are connected by a single nervous system, but each individual has its own independently-functioning brain. This enables each limb to think for itself, which is valuable in critical emergencies; however, in order to work most efficiently, the other six limbs will normally follow the orders of the head, which functions as the leader of the seven. Individual Barbaracle have been known to “secede” from their bodies by dissolving the cement binding them to their rocks, however, if they disagree with the orders they are given.
While the individuals serving as the arms and legs of a Barbaracle have rather obvious purposes, the two units on the shoulders possess less clear jobs. They are known as the “scout” individuals, who use their eyes to help Barbaracle scan the entire area around them; though all eyes of a Barbaracle are fully functional, the scouts are entirely dedicated to keeping watch. These two scout limbs, along with the other appendages as well as the heads, can be used to brutally assail opponents with barrages of sharp claws and the equivalent strength of seven individuals.
",Collective Pokémon,"rock,water",4′03″,211.6
skrelp,"Skrelp blend in with floating seaweed to camouflage themselves, hiding from predators to store up power for evolution, while also feeding on rotten seaweed as their main diet. They prey on unsuspecting marine Pokémon that mistake them for food, which they spray toxins at to finish off. Skrelp from Alola are often found near Dhelmise. 
To create the toxins in their bodies, Skrelp usually diet on rotten seaweeds to sustain themselves if they are not hunting for marine Pokémon.
",Mock Kelp Pokémon,"poison,water",1′08″,16.1
dragalge,"Dragalge is an aggressive and territorial Poison-type Pokémon. One will spit a powerful acidic poison at anything that enters its territory. Legends suggest that Dragalge attacked and destroyed ships that wandered into seas where this Pokémon resides. Dragalge can spit poison strong enough to eat through the hull of a tanker; this territorial Pokémon will spit this poison at whatever trespasses their territories. As a result, it is said that ships sailing through the seas where they live never return. 
They are also known for their stealth, concealing themselves in seaweeds, before assailing fatal hits of poison aimed at their unsuspecting prey. 
While remaining as a ruthlessly dangerous creature, Dragalge love to sunbathe and stick out their heads from the ocean's surface; this allows Dragalge to release their draconic energies. Curiously, it is unknown why Dragalge tend to have good relationships with Dhelmise.
In the Paldea region, Dragalge is the natural predator of Finizen. 
",Mock Kelp Pokémon,"poison,dragon",5′11″,179.7
clauncher,"Clauncher is able to use its large claw as a pistol, launching spheres of compressed water to defeat opponents. If it loses a claw in battle, Clauncher is able to grow back a new one. The flesh of a Clauncher's claw is somewhat regarded as a delicacy in both Alola and Galar. 
",Water Gun Pokémon,water,1′08″,18.3
clawitzer,"Clawitzer detects prey with the feelers attached to its massive claws before launching cannonballs made out of seawater. These cannonballs have enough strength to not only puncture and submerge a large tanker ship, but also rip through a large metal sheet. Clawitzer uses water released from its rear nozzle to propel forward at 60 knots.

Also, when it is attacking, it opens the ""ear-like"" structures on its head.Helioptile make their homes in hot, flat deserts where there are few trees to block out the sunlight. These Pokémon are adapted to the sweltering, dry conditions of deserts and can survive for long periods of time without drinking water.On cloudy days, Helioptile will hide themselves and lie dormant in order to conserve as much energy as possible until the sun comes out again. Today, modern solar panel technology is based largely upon extended scientific research on the abilities of Helioptile and their evolutions, Heliolisk, to take advantage of the photoelectric effect.
",Generator Pokémon,"electric,normal",1′08″,13.2
heliolisk,"When emitting electricity, it extends the frills on its neck, which flare up, resembling a sun-like shape.This allows it to charge itself.they must recharge after such energy-demanding tasks. Heliolisk spend much of their time standing still with their frills unfolded in the sun to gather energy. During mating season, these diurnal Pokémon will unfold and light up their frills to attract mates. Individuals with the largest frills are deemed the most attractive. 
An ancient desert culture once praised Heliolisk, believing them to be mystical and connected to a deity they worshipped. When this culture's ruins were excavated by Galarian archaeologists, a number of Heliolisk snuck on board with the unearthed artifacts and made it to Galar, establishing the population that exists there today.
Because of its ability to stimulate muscle strength via electricity, Heliolisk is able to run 100 yards within 5 seconds. 
",Generator Pokémon,"electric,normal",3′03″,46.3
tyrunt,"Tyrunt have extremely powerful jawbones that can crunch with enough pressure to flatten automobile parts. These strong bones make their heads very heavy, so it is very difficult for Tyrunt to stand upright; consequently, they often hold their heads very close to the ground. Tyrunt are extremely finicky Pokémon; they will throw wild tantrums when they are displeased by something. Trainers of Tyrunt often report that their Pokémon will enter property-destroying fits of anger after slights as minor as being served a food that they dislike. Commonly characterized as spoiled, they do not play well with others and often hurt smaller Pokémon when roughhousing. Tyrunt also despise doing practically anything on their own; in the wild, Tyrunt were cared for entirely by their parents, who would bring them food, bathe them, and even lull them to sleep. Consequently, orphaned Tyrunt rarely survived for long without their parents. 
",Royal Heir Pokémon,"rock,dragon",2′07″,57.3
tyrantrum,"Tyrantrum has immense jaw strength, allowing it to easily tear apart both a large metal sheet and a car. During the time it roamed the Earth, Tyrantrum was considered to be unbeatable. 
Many scientists theorized that Tyrantrum may have feathers growing out of its body.  
Tyrantrum lived 100 million years ago. Its vicious, but regal and magnificent, poise signified a kingly presence.
As the top of the food chain, Tyrantrum had little to worry about other than finding food and were believed to essentially rule ancient jungles like kings—they ate anything and travelled anywhere they wanted to.
Tyrantrum, however, often ended up being controlled by a certain other species of Pokémon—their own offspring Tyrunt. Greatly protective of their young, Tyrantrum would go to great lengths in order to please their incredibly picky children.

aurorus,"Aurorus are large, slow Pokémon that once inhabited frozen tundras. Because of their harsh environments, they did not have to fear most predators, who could not survive the cold; Aurorus have antifreeze proteins in their blood that enable them to endure freezing temperatures. The crystals on these Pokémon chill the surrounding air to temperatures as low as -240°F (-150°C), allowing them to instantly freezing moisture in the air. Aurorus use this ability to form blocks of ice in front of them and block incoming attacks; when threatened, they may also try to encase their foes in ice. These Pokémon can also create aurora-like lights by diffracting light through tiny ice crystals in the air, often howling as they do. Because Aurorus relied primarily on the bitter cold to keep predators away from them, they likely went extinct during an ancient warming period in which much of the world’s ice melted. Such an event allowed many predators, who saw the large, yet slow and relatively defensive Aurorus as easy prey, to venture further north into once-icy regions. Scientists have recently discovered a fully-intact Aurorus frozen in a northern glacier; it is believed that the Aurorus froze itself to protect itself from some sort of danger, though the nature of this threat is unknown.
They dwell in prehistoric glaciers and tundras.
",Tundra Pokémon,"rock,ice",8′10″,496
sylveon,"Sylveon is a kind and gentle Pokémon; one uses its charm to hunt in the wild. They use their ribbonlike feelers to hold hands with their Trainers and walk alongside them, enabling them to sense the feelings of their Trainers. They can bring even the most intense battles to a halt by using their feelers to exude an aura of peace and tranquillity, causing those near them to lose their fighting spirit, before they strikes a powerful and unexpected attack. Their movements are graceful and fluid, making them appear to be almost weightless. They are known to captivate or charm others with a gentle, calming, and rather adorable ""Nyaaah~"" noise, which they often make when using moves such as Attract or Charm to enchant a target.
Sylveon are also very attractive to other Pokémon, which provides their an advantage on luring prey with their appearance in the wild through deception. This means that they can enamour a predator or a prey item with their charming looks, and gain an advantage. Despite having an adorable and graceful appearance, Sylveon are heavily implied to be carnivorous according to Pokédex entries.
When riled up, Sylveon will become fearless and will not hesitate to strike, no matter how large its opponents are. Galarian fairy tales have even depicted tales of Sylveon defeating ferocious dragon Pokémon.
Sylveon are most commonly found in urban areas, as it relies humans to evolve it from Eevee with strong friendships. Only few are spotted in the wild.

hawlucha,"Despite its small size, Hawlucha is capable of fighting other Fighting-type Pokémon. It attacks by staying in their blind spots, such as from above, considering that they are also part Flying-type. 
Hawlucha uses its small body frame to tire out larger opponents before finishing them with a flashy and stylish move. However, it tends to become a show-off after performing such a technique and most opponents take advantage of this to win. 
Hawlucha in Paldea tend to be solitary, preferring quiet lifestyles and usually do not flock together. For this reason, they despise Primeape and frequently fight noisy groups of them.
",Wrestling Pokémon,"fighting,flying",2′07″,47.4

goodra,"Goodra are cheerful and affectionate Pokémon. Because of this, Goodra are often teased. However, they will strike at their tormentors with their retractable horns and powerful tails.

klefki,"Klefki has a habit of collecting keys, especially master keys; it sometimes attempt to sneak into people's homes to obtain keys, and giving a key to it makes the Pokémon very happy. It never lets go a key it has collected and will fiercely jingle its keys at aggressors, so people would entrust Klefki with the keys to vaults and safes to prevent crime, and royalties and nobles in the past would take good care of Klefki and pass each down for generations. However, due to their pickiness, they will discard keys they dislike after absorbing the keys' metal ions, while hanging onto ones that they favor for decades.
It should be noted that Klefki used to dwell in mines long ago, but they became more mingled with humans and started residing in human settlements after the minerals they diet on became more scarce.

Pumpkaboo carry souls inside of their hollow bodies. Smaller Pumpkaboo are made up of fewer souls but larger Pumpkaboo are made up of more souls. In addition, smaller Pumpkaboo prefer children while larger Pumpkaboo prefer adults. Pumpkaboo are thought to act as psychopomps, leading recently deceased souls to places where they can move on. The Pokémon Dusknoir are believed to pick these spirits up here to ferry them into the world of the dead while Pumpkaboo remain behind.

avalugg,"A slow but immensely powerful Pokémon, Avalugg are capable of crushing any obstacle that stands in their way. They are often seen carrying groups of Bergmite on their backs in a manner similar to an aircraft carrier. The Bergmite on their backs will lodge themselves into their crevasses, covering them in sharp and icy spikes. With their backsides protected, Avalugg will then try to crush foes with their weight. Avalugg are diurnal Pokémon; their crevasses can be observed widening in the morning sun as they go about their day before rebuilding as they rest for the night.
",Iceberg Pokémon,ice,6′07″,1113.3
noibat,"Noibat can be found in dark caves where little to no light penetrates. Because vision is largely useless in these areas, Noibat have adapted to navigate their surroundings through echolocation.The pitches that Noibat use for echolocation can be disorienting even to people and Pokémon that do not consciously hear them; pro-wrestlers trained to maintain their balance can become dizzy when near these Pokémon. People traveling in Noibat caves often become lost because of the disorienting sounds. Noibat use this ability when threatened to confuse foes and escape 
Since it uses sound waves to detect the ripeness of fruit, it won't eat fruit that's sour resulting in it being a picky eater.
Noibat trainers are advised to wear special headphones that block out such frequencies

noivern,"Noivern has an aggressive temperament and will ruthlessly taunt its opponents in the dark. Supposedly, it will attack anything that wanders too close to it. Enemies that are weakened by the sound waves are dealt with the finishing blow by Noivern's fangs. However, Noivern can be tamed by trustworthy trainers if given a fruit to eat.  
They communicate warnings to other Noivern about territorial boundaries using sonar; those unfortunate enough to be caught between two conflicting Noivern may sometimes faint from dizziness.

hoopa,"The mythical Hoopa is said to be a troublemaking trickster that can open portals to other dimensions with its hoop. It is thought to use this ability to cause interdimensional mischief, though some believe that it also uses it to hoard objects that catch its interest in some unknown realm. Long ago, an ancient desert civilization was said to have sealed Hoopa's true power away in an artifact known as the Prison Bottle. Opening the bottle would restore its strength for a short time; in this form, known as Unbound Hoopa, it becomes a monstrous, six-handed beast that would be able to transport anything between dimensions. Legends say that this gigantic creature once carried an entire castle of gold along with it through a hyperspace hole because of its greed. Luckily, this transformation is only temporary; after some time, the Prison Bottle will reabsorb its power and Hoopa will once again become Confined. It is thought that Confined Hoopa passes its time by playing tricks on unwary beings across dimensions.
",Mischief Pokémon,"psychic,ghost",1′08″,19.8
volcanion,"In order to conceal itself and vanish, Volcanion releases plumes of steam. It has been said to inhabit certain mountain areas that are considered forbidden for humans to walk. Some people believe that this Pokémon may dislike humans because it was alive to witness the horrible destruction that the great war of Kalos left behind 3,000 years ago.
",Steam Pokémon,"fire,water",5′07″,429.9
rowlet,"Rowlet is a crafty Pokémon that uses the art of stealth to its advantage. Using its delicate wings, it silently draws near its targets and viciously attacks them with sharp feathers and kicks before they even notice it. It's also clever enough to use tactics: if an enemy is far away, it may send its sharp feathers flying rather than getting close. If the foe draws near, it'll switch and attack with kicks instead. At night, it glides through the air on the hunt for prey, while in the day, it sleeps and builds up the energy it'll use for hunting. In battle, it has a tendency to turn its head around to look at its Trainer, showcasing a display of its observational skills.
",Grass Quill Pokémon,"grass,flying",1′00″,3.3
dartrix,"Revealing a certain snobbishness in their personalities, Dartrix care a great deal about their appearances, grooming their feathers in every spare moment. Such meticulous grooming is for sharpening their feathers in their case for self defense. They also bask themselves in sunlight to store up their own energy. If their trainers are too sloppy to pamper and tidy them, they will become quite disobedient.
In truth, they're also a bit of a birdbrain, with a tendency to bungle things up. Once they make a mistake, they sometimes get into a desperate struggle to gloss over the situation and end up making a bigger mess than ever. They also care about their own cleanliness: they can feel bothered by their dirty or ruffled feathers that they can't focus on battle. When they loses their focus, they sometimes even retire from the battle on the spot.
",Blade Quill Pokémon,"grass,flying",2′04″,35.3
decidueye,"Decidueye are normally calm and collected but panic easily when taken by surprise. One will tug at its ""hoodie"" if missing a very important or accurate shot. When a Decidueye decides upon a target, it will seemingly disappear from view as it begins to stalk it from afar. Once its victim completely loses track of it, it will strike with a single arrow quill, plucking it from within its wing and stringing it on its vine-like tassels. Many trainers still admire Decidueye for their spectacular precision and stealth, making them one of the most popular starters in Alola.
",Arrow Quill Pokémon,"grass,ghost",5′03″,80.7
litten,"Litten always appears to be very calm, and does not show emotion. Since they don't bond with many people, Litten are hardheaded and stubborn. However, when its trainer and partners get into a pinch, it will make an effort to save everyone it trusts and cares about. 
Litten spends most of its time grooming its fur; any pieces of loose fur are ingested and used as fuel for fire-based attacks. However, Litten can be a bit wary and will use its sharp claws to lash out at any human that tries to pet it without gaining its trust.  
",Fire Cat Pokémon,fire,1′04″,9.5
torracat,"This flame sac is directly connected to the brains of Torracat and reacts specifically to their mood. When they are calm, the bell remains unlit, but the moment their temper spikes and they feel angry or ready for a scuffle, the bell will ignite and start to produce a bright flame.When they are extremely agitated or excited, the bell will even produce a ringing sound as the temperature of the flame inside of it increases over time.Torracat in fact act somewhat bratty around familiar faces. Some would even call them spoiled; they may even scratch their trainers if they displease them.Their fur will stand on end when Torracat healthy and happy, but lie flat and matted when they are sick or upset. Torracat use their thick manes, which have actually adapted to take the place of standard whiskers, to navigate dark areas. This helps them locate prey in the dim undergrowth of their jungle habitats or under the cover of dark nights. 
Torracat are fierce fighters and have a great love for battle, oftentimes attacking their opponents relentlessly to the point where the opposition loses the will to fight.
",Fire Cat Pokémon,fire,2′04″,55.1
incineroar,"Incineroar is a violent, aggressive Pokémon known for its brutal prowess in battle; this trait allows Incineroar to excel in battles without holding back on its own. It is known to be indifferent and arrogant, even refusing to battle weak or injured foes, though it is said Incineroar deep down loves praise and attention and plays its antagonistic ""heel"" impression for show.
When battling, Incineroar can get too immersed in participating in the combat, and in worst cases one can drag their innocent Trainer into the fight. This makes Incineroar being spurned by the majority who keep their distance with them. 
When they start to get attached to small Pokémon and children, nonetheless, Incineroar actually feel immense joy even though they usually put up a cool facade towards the former. In fact, they will have their fighting spirit attenuated when they have to battle against a more feeble foe, which can unfortunately let down their guard and being taken advantage of.
Despite its seemingly brutal disposition, Incineroar is actually very friendly towards children and will even help out small Pokémon.  
",Heel Pokémon,"fire,dark",5′11″,183
popplio,"Popplio will frequently work on blowing&#160;bubbles and try to get them larger than their bodies. Instead of walking, Popplio will generate and use their bubbles as a springboard, popping as they leap on top of them in order to get a bounce out of them as they pop, in turn allowing them to perform acrobatic stunts in their leaps to please those they enjoy playing with. 
These Pokémon are also playful when not practicing; they love to perform acrobatic tricks with their bubbles in front of others, which also serve as trial runs for new strategies in battle. After gaining height by bouncing on these bubbles, they can attack opponents from the air in highly technical maneuvers. They can also pop their bubbles to damage foes with surprising force. Because of their dedication, playfulness, and acrobatic capabilities in battle, Popplio make an excellent choice of starter Pokémon for any Alolan trainer.
",Sea Lion Pokémon,water,1′04″,16.5
brionne,"Brionne usually learns its dance moves from other colony members or even humans, and will pay all its effort practicing its skills until it can memorize them. It uses them in battle to disarray the opponent before attacking it. Sometimes, in nights with the moon high up in the sky, you can see a lot of Brionne dancing together under the shining moonlight. These Pokémon never fail to get excited when they witness a new dance that they have yet to perfect.
Also, Brionne mostly smiles and won't show a sad face to others unless it trusts its Trainer and Pokémon friends.
",Pop Star Pokémon,water,2′00″,38.6
primarina,"Trainers who raise Popplio watch their tireless practice and dedication finally pay off when they evolve into Primarina. Primarina, as the Pokédex says, sees every battle as a stage, prompting people to call it a songstress. Unfortunately, it might suffer from sore throats, especially when its voice isn't maintained well. Dry weather, consecutive battles, and throat damage all imperil their vocal abilities. Those that do manage this task, however, are able to battle alongside some of the most renowned performers in the world.
In battle, Primarina use the vibrations created by their voices to maneuver sparkling bubbles around the field. Only some of these bubbles are explosive; they can leap around on the non-volatile ones to further play with opponents. The sight of a field of Primarina bubbles glittering in the moonlight is said to be breathtaking. Primarina teach one another new songs in their colonies, passing them down over the generations. They lead beautiful seaside concerts on moonlit nights. Consequently, each colony has its own unique repertoire.
Wild Primarina usually live in colonies. The leading Primarina always hold their performances during moonlit nights. They are also carnivores, luring their unsuspecting prey with beautiful and dancing.
",Soloist Pokémon,"water,fairy",5′11″,97
pikipek,"Pikipek drill holes in trees for food storage. However, they also adore small, shiny objects, and will take these and store them in the aforementioned food holes.
Despite their small stature, Pikipek in fact have incredibly strong neck muscles that enable them to peck with such strength. Their drilling is very noisy; they use different rhythms of pecking in order to communicate with one another. Since their signals are loud and distinct from one another, people that live near them often learn to recognize what different rhythms mean. In fact, Pikipek communication is one of the most well-studied in the field. Pikipek also have a fondness of shiny objects, storing them in tree holes. This is the root of the Alolan saying, ""Something lost, something missed, check inside the Pikipek nest"". 
Pikipek can also shoot seeds with great force from their beaks. They will pull seeds from their tree holes to fire at attackers from a distance when threatened; missed seeds often end up lodged in the bark of other trees. Since the seeds are frequently destroyed by this, however, Pikipek cannot store them effectively this way.
",Woodpecker Pokémon,"normal,flying",1′00″,2.6
trumbeak,"Trumbeak are diligent and practical, and they are also loving caretakers who look after Pikipek with Toucannon. Be that as it may, Trumbeak is hated by humans on account of its noisiness. They are infamous for their loud, bugle-like calls as well as their lack of regard for quietude. 
The tips of their beaks are flexible and can bend backwards like “lips”. This allows them to buzz air through them in order to create their signature trumpeting. Though Trumbeak do not live together in the wild, they are not territorial towards others of their kind. In fact, they communicate with one another through their raucous calling. Plants in Trumbeak habitats often have hard-shelled seeds that can withstand firing, and Trumbeak prefer these seeds because they are more effective at deterring attackers. In the late spring, male Trumbeak will begin to call even more loudly and cacophonously as they try to attract mates, much to the chagrin of people and other Pokémon alike.
",Bugle Beak Pokémon,"normal,flying",2′00″,32.6
toucannon,"Toucannon express their moods with their kind by knocking their beaks as a means of communication, each time with varied frequencies and intensities of each knock.
In addition, Toucannon are well known for being faithful and harmonious with their mates, thus they are frequently being brought to weddings as lucky blessings for newlyweds.
",Cannon Pokémon,"normal,flying",3′07″,57.3
yungoos,"Because of its long body, a Yungoos always gets hungry and they eat without manners. They roam around all day searching for prey (Rattata in particular) but at nightfall quickly lose all stamina and fall asleep.
To hunt, Yungoos stake out a particular route and then patrol it back and forth for prey. They do not stray from their paths, which they try to set in areas safe from larger predators. They strongly prefer live prey and will only scavenge as an absolute last resort.
A diurnal creature, Yungoos was introduced to Alola to deal with the invasive Rattata. However, as they hunted during the day the Rattata became nocturnal to avoid the new daytime predator.
",Loitering Pokémon,normal,1′04″,13.2
gumshoos,"Gumshoos deploy the opposite strategy from Yungoos when hunting. Instead of prowling around for its prey, Gumshoos stakes out its prey's usual routes and waits for it come by. It's known to be patient and persistent.
These Pokémon are tenacious and will stick to a single target until they succeed. One trait these Pokémon do have in common with Yungoos, however, is that they are also diurnal. When the sun sets, Gumshoos will fall asleep right where they stand, exhausted from a day’s worth of keeping watch. Gumshoos do have a preference for Alolan Rattata and Raticate, which is why they were imported in the first place. They are rarely able to hunt them, however, because of how their prey have adapted. Though normally quite patient, Gumshoos will get very excited when they sight an unfortunate wild Rattata. 
Forests and grasslands have common sightings of this species of Pokémon
",Stakeout Pokémon,normal,2′04″,31.3
grubbin,"Grubbin loves electricity and lives around power plants.In order to stay safe from avian Pokémon, Grubbin often make their homes near or in the habitats of Electric-type Pokémon, as Flying-types are weak to them and usually avoid places where they congregate.
Grubbin have strong mandibles that they use for almost everything. They use them to burrow underground, for instance, where they spend the majority of their time. Grubbin also use their jaws to scrape away at the bark of trees and feed on exposed sap.They will use their mandibles to dig their nests into the soil. 
Though very slow on the ground, Grubbin can escape from peril by shooting sticky threads to attach themselves to branches or wires and then swing away like tiny acrobats. Once they are safely away from danger, they can simply cut the strands with their sharp mandibles to free themselves. They can also bind attackers with these threads to slow them down and buy time to flee. Smaller avian Pokémon like Rookidee are often wary of tangling with Grubbin because of their powerful mandibles.
",Larva Pokémon,bug,1′04″,9.7
charjabug,"Since one is preparing to evolve, it usually looks motionless. Most of the time it buries its body for spending time underground.Charjabug are a bit more active than other intermediate insects, though this isn't saying much. Unlike Metapod or Cascoon, Charjabug are capable of consuming solid foods. They are opportunistic feeders that eat whatever plant matter they can find nearby, including decaying humus. Charjabug use what little food they eat to produce electrical energy using special organs in their abdomens; they can also siphon power from generators, and in fact seem to prefer this (as this method does not require movement). They then store this energy inside electric sacs within their bodies, which they can utilize to defend themselves from foes by discharging electricity from the tips of their jaws. Their sturdy shells also help keep them protected from predators. Their evolutions Vikavolt will hold and draw electricity from them to defend themselves.
",Battery Pokémon,"bug,electric",1′08″,23.1
vikavolt,"Vikavolt produces electricity through an electric sac within its abdomen. It is able to release its electrical energy from its mouth by firing it as powerful beams, similar to a railgun. Vikavolt can clamp onto a Charjabug and use it as an extra battery in order to launch more powerful electric blasts. It uses these blasts to protect against bird Pokémon.Vikavolt will also grasp their pre-evolutions, Charjabug, in their ​legs as they fly, using them as additional energy sources (since Vikavolt are defending their relatives by doing this, the Charjabug usually don't mind). However, the extra weight slows them down somewhat and makes it harder for them to fly.    
Vikavolt shares a strong rivalry with Pinsir. 
",Stag Beetle Pokémon,"bug,electric",4′11″,99.2
crabrawler,"A competitive Pokémon that hates to lose, this Pokémon uses its large claws as protection for its face and belly while it closes in on opponents. Crabrawler's pincers sometimes break off from overuse, but they grow back quickly. Crabrawler strives to achieve not only a high social standing, but a physically higher position as well. It can be found clinging to buildings or even tall people, and will punch anyone who attempts to remove it from its perch. In the event that it does lose, its mouth will foam before it faints.
While it is capable of splitting tree trunks, it usually punches trees to knock down ripe berries. Many Crabrawler will gather around a tree to compete for the ripe berries. &#160;Crabrawler also preys on Exeggcute. It has been known to mistake Exeggutor for coconut trees, which shake and stomp Crabrawler off when climbed.

During rain, it takes shelter in the hollow of a tree and stays there until the rain recedes. It hates rain, as rain makes pollen damp and reveals itself only after a few clear days pass by in a row. They seem to a appreciate acts of kindness as Lana gave it the flower bracelet repaying her and Mallow with two pollen puffs.
",Bee Fly Pokémon,"bug,fairy",0′08″,1.1
rockruff,"Rockruff like to show their affection by hitting the rocks onto their Trainers. Unfortunately, this may make their Trainers feel painful. However, they usually become fierce during the time they grow older, and howl at evenings when they are going to evolve into Lycanroc. When they know that they will evolve, they might leave their Trainers for a while until their evolutions are completed. There are tales of it reuniting with its Trainer after becoming lost by following the faintest traces of scent. It has lived with humans since ancient times. 
Rockruff is often recommended as a good beginner due to its friendly nature. It can bond with Trainers easily. However, Rockruff is said to be a challenging Pokémon to raise especially when they are reaching closer to evolution; as mentioned, they will become more volatile and aggressive, to the point where some Trainers abandon them due to being unable to handle theirs. 
This Pokémon is very sociable and will greet others by rubbing them with the rocks around its neck, although still maintaining a territorial nature. A Rockruff normally intimidates opponents by using the rocks on its neck to hit the ground. As mentioned in the anime, Rockruff trains itself by running around. It attacks foes the moment they flinch. It has also been known to fight with Growlithe over territory.
",Puppy Pokémon,rock,1′08″,20.3
lycanroc,"As Rockruff nears evolution, it becomes more aggressive and prone to howling loudly. It then runs away and disappears, only returning to its trainer once it has evolved. In Paldea, farmers use Lycanroc as guard dogs in order to protect their crops from Deerling. 
",Wolf Pokémon,rock,2′07″,55.1
wishiwashi,"Small and weak on its own, Wishiwashi is targeted by many predators that see it as an easy meal. In order to defend itself, large numbers of Wishiwashi come together into their massive and terrifying School Form, and their combined power surpasses that of even Gyarados. Alolan sea folk fear Wishiwashi, speaking of it as the ""demon of the sea"". However, even in large schools Wishiwashi still falls prey to Wailord.

mareanie,"Mareanie is usually found moving along the ocean floor near coastal areas. The spike on top of its head contains a deadly toxin that is injected into prey. Mareanie is also able to finish off its weakened victim with all ten of its tentacles. They are widely loathed by craftsmen, who collect and work with Corsola branches, as a result.
Although most Mareanie and Toxapex prey on Corsola in Alola, the Mareanie from Galar are stated to have not yet tasted the branches of Corsola, possibly with Corsola being a Ghost type Pokémon in Galar due to being wiped out by sudden changes in ocean temperature.
In Paldea, Mareanie there have also never tasted Corsola before. They wander the seaside looking for food, but whenever they want to consume fallen Pincurchin spikes, they always get electrocuted.
",Brutal Star Pokémon,"poison,water",1′04″,17.6
toxapex,"Toxapex, as a predator, is slow, being only able to crawl along the seafloor and beaches in search of prey. Its favorite food is Corsola, possibly referencing the fact that the two creatures they are based on the Thorn Of Crowns Sea Star and Coral are predator and prey in reality. In theory, Toxapex will wait for prey to come by, hiding itself behind rocks or under sand, until it is either in arms or tentacle, reach or at least close enough to be chase worthy. By deploying its toxic spikes as its main attack, anyone who approaches it will be mowed by the claws and even get poisoned.
In order to survive colder waters like those in Galar, Toxapex can protect themselves by forming domes with their legs. This blocks the flow of tides, which make them feel very comfortable and safe within their own bunker.
Toxapex are also known for competing with Bruxish over oceanic areas full of warm currents, but they tend to have the odds against them, owing to their disadvantageous Poison-type against Bruxish's more advantageous Psychic-types.

Salandit in fact prefer to sneak up on prey from behind and immobilize them with their fumes before the victims even notice. Humorously, Salandit have great trouble hunting Spinda, as their dizzying gases have little effect on these tipsy Pokémon.
Female Salandit can eventually evolve into Salazzle. Male Salandit are highly attracted to Salazzle, offering both food and even their lives to gain her affection by the end of mating season. Due to the devotion towards Salazzle, male Salandit are highly malnourished and incapable of evolving.
",Toxic Lizard Pokémon,"poison,fire",2′00″,10.6
salazzle,"Salazzle emit toxic fumes that contain pheromones that attract any males in the area and cause them to be easily controlled by Salazzle. A Salazzle lives with a reverse harem of male Salandit. If one of its Salandit fail to bring it food, it will slap the male with its palm. These males are in fact willing to lay down their lives for their leader in the name of “love.” 
Salazzle can also defend themselves with noxious fumes and flames, but they rarely elect to do so, instead sending in Salandit after Salandit to battle in their places. When mating season arrives, Salandit will forgo eating and sleeping to search for gifts to bring back to their Salazzle in hopes of earning their favor. Salazzle will choose a single lucky Salandit to mate with, while the rest will have to wait another year to try again. Female Salazzle with larger harems assert dominance over those with fewer Salandit under their control.

Its hugs are powerful enough to shatter bones. Many Trainers are said to have left the world after receiving Bewear's hugs. Bewear uses its arms to subdue its prey before taking it back to its nest.

When under attack, they often exude more of the aroma through the form of sweat, which draws more enemies to them, or rotate the calyx on their heads, which makes them dizzy. They have also been known to flee, but the way they skip and amble about doesn't adequately show their fear, ensuring that nothing ever comes to their aid.

In their evolutionary family, only the strongest Steenee can evolve under the blessings of its kind. Upon evolving, Tsareena will gain excessive strength that helps them to master their leg power even better than Steenee. The majority of them take up the responsibilities of guarding and protecting other Steenee and Bounsweet, even becoming aggressively defensive to outsiders (especially bird Pokémon) that they consider dangerous to fellow Bounsweet. Some may describe Tsareena as merciless, since they laugh boisterously after cruelly stomping and defeating their foes with their curvy and sharp legs, which inflict both physical and psychological agony in an everlasting way to the victims.
In Paldea, Tsareena tend to see Quaquaval as rivals.

Oranguru can be difficult to raise, as they look down on trainers less knowledgeable than themselves and tend to act on their own accords. They also don't get along well with others of their kind, engaging in intellectual battles of wits when encountering one another to prove superiority (and territorial claims). Shockingly, Oranguru have proven able to learn how to manipulate human inventions like Potions all on their own. Some have even reported seeing Oranguru use Poké Balls in the wild.

These Pokémon excel when it comes to teamwork. Bosses will select 10 of the fittest members to accompany them as they search for Berries; this is done on a case-by-case basis, so Passimian must constantly train themselves to stay in peak condition. Each Passimian in a team performs a particular assigned role when foraging. Bosses will also routinely conduct training exercises in which troop members must pass Berries to one another both quickly and accurately. The Passimian that can throw a Berry the farthest is the de facto leader. These sessions are often long and laborious; some Passimian even end up running away because they are unable to handle the pressure. 
Passimian lob Berries at foes to defend themselves. They use soft ones to obscure their vision and hard ones to batter and bruise them. Troop members will never leave a comrade behind. Most bosses pass down special techniques from generation to generation. Domesticated Passimian watch their trainers closely as they throw their Poké Balls; they look down on those with poor form.

Some say this is done by spirits of the dead, while others believe that they are possessed by the manifested grudges of people and Pokémon. Sandygast dwell on sandy beaches, where they blend in perfectly with their surroundings. They use their bright red shovels to lure in small children; those who grab their shovels fall under their influences and are compelled to begin adding more sand to their bodies, making them larger.
If a Sandygast loses its shovel, it may instead temporarily use a tree branch, flag, or other sturdy object it finds on the shore until it can find its shovel again. They are very protective of these tools and will try their best to fight to regain them if stolen. Sandygast can suck the life force of living beings with their gaping mouths. In Alola, it is a test of courage to stick one's hand in a Sandygast's orifice.
Obviously, beach-going parents warn their children to not play with wild Sandygast or grab their red shovels. Incidence rates of such occurrences, however, have remained stagnant for decades despite these warnings. Children playing on beaches where Sandygast are known to be found are warned to knock down piles of sand they build before leaving in order to prevent possible possessions.

The bones of Palossand's victims are buried deep underneath it. It is theorized that the shovel on top of Palossand's head functions similar to radar; the shovel rotates whenever Palossand is hunting prey.

Despite their perpetual slumbers, however, Komala seem hazily aware of their surroundings; they seem to process outside stimuli within their dreams, as some sounds and physical touches register noticeably in their brain wave patterns.

mimikyu,"Apparently, about 20 years ago, it was said that Pikachu is more popular than them, so they dressed up like Pikachu in order to become more popular among Trainers.
In the case of one notable Mimikyu in the anime, it has been shown to harbor an immense, almost psychopathic hatred toward all Pikachu, especially Ash's. This may not be the case for all Mimikyu however, and it is likely that different Mimikyu have different attitudes toward Pikachu.
Mimikyu is said to be a cursed being, and those who have seen under their rags have all died painfully out of shock. In the anime, Meowth saw Mimikyu's true form several times (though partially) and fainted several times before being returned to his senses soon after.
However, most Mimikyu mean no actual harm, and in fact only want to make friends with humans. As such, they hide their true forms under a costume representing what people loved the most; Pikachu, though when attacked, they will show one or both of their claws that hide underneath the cloth they wear and strike back.

Bruxish then stun their victims with psychokinesis before using their hard teeth to grind away. When they molar their teeth, other Pokémon will know that is a hint of danger and flee away.

Travelers will almost inevitably hear Jangmo-o in the wild before actually spotting them. Ancient tribes used to collect Jangmo-o scales and fashion war instruments out of them. They believed that ringing these instruments prior to battle would ensure their warriors fought bravely and valiantly. Anthropological excavations suggest that Jangmo-o were popular partners for military combatants in ancient Alolan society. Recently, scientists have found evidence that Jangmo-o scales are not, in fact, modified reptilian scales, but actually hardened fur; the implications of this finding have yet to be explored.

Additionally, Meltan can contact the rest of its kind to its current location when its bodies vibrates by the result of contacting with any soundwave-related metallic items like school bells nearby, just as its head spins much faster.
Meltan can be very curious, showing interest in many things. They also spin their hex nut heads a sign of affection towards others and when happy.
",Hex Nut Pokémon,steel,0′08″,17.6
melmetal,"Melmetal was thought to be revered by humans many years ago because of its ability to manipulate and create metal from nothingness. However this was not shown in any media so far.Melmetal was considered a sacred being that lived in a secluded area deep within a wooded land that was full of sedimentary rocks rich with magnetite. When Melmetal reaches the end of its life, it will rust and split itself into multiple Meltan from the small shards left behind. The process of evolution has hardened its body, making it incredibly sturdy. However, it is still in a liquid state and has some flexibility, particularly in its arms. The strength of the heavy hex nut arms comes from the centrifugal force, which allows Melmetal to have the strongest punch of all Pokémon. Melmetal is said to be created when one strong Meltan absorbs the group it lives with in order to evolve. 
",Hex Nut Pokémon,steel,8′02″,1763.7
grookey,"Grookey are full of curiosity and also quite mischievous. They are considered to be a mood maker as their demeanor can make just about anyone happy. Like Braixen, they are also very attached to the branches on the top of their heads. One usually sleeps on the arms of its Trainer or family members. After Grookey are born, they grab a stick from a nearby tree and carry it with them for the rest of their lives. These sticks become infused with Grookey's energy by being around them. 
In the wild, Grookey live in troops with others of their kind. Their green fur contains chlorophyll and synthesizes sunlight into energy. Grookey troops can be heard from afar drumming in time on hard Berries. Trainers that do not take life seriously and enjoy dancing to their own rhythm will appreciate Grookey as their first Pokémon.
",Chimp Pokémon,grass,1′00″,11
thwackey,"Thwackey keeps a steady beat during its daily life. It walks while swaying back and forth to a rhythm and drumming with its twin sticks. Due to being immersed with its practicing, it oftentimes neglect its trainer's instructions. Some have even witnessed Thwackey honing its skills when it is eating.
",Beat Pokémon,grass,2′04″,30.9
rillaboom,"Rillaboom have a gentle nature and won't involve themselves in trivial fights. However, they are extremely sensitive to any actions that could risk the harmony around them, so they keep such actions strictly in check. Rillaboom have a strong sense of solidarity with others, and they will fight ferociously when their allies are in trouble. The Rillaboom who has displayed the best drumming technique becomes the leader.
Other Pokémon will congregate around performing Rillaboom to watch them drum and dance along. In Galarian folklore, it is said that as long as these Pokémon are drumming, the rules of nature are temporarily suspended, and predator and prey will dance together as companions. Trainers who prefer cooperation over competition and do not take life too seriously will find Rillaboom excellent companion Pokémon.
Gigantamax Rillaboom focuses completely on playing its drums, compelled by the power welling up inside it. The sound can reach across oceans and be heard by those living in other regions. It's said that those who hear the beat will begin to dance uncontrollably, overwhelmed by a rhythm that surges up from inside them.
",Drummer Pokémon,grass,6′11″,198.4
scorbunny,"Scorbunny is always bursting with energy. It uses its agility and natural kicking skills to confuse opponents. According to the anime, a Scorbunny's foot is said to bring good luck, a reference to how a rabbit's foot is often used as a good luck charm. They take time to heat up, however, as the contents of Scorbunny's flame sacs are viscous and need to soften before use. For this reason, Scorbunny need to warm up before battles by running laps. This increases their heart rate and body temperatures, helping them reach their full potentials. These flame sacs are sometimes called their ""second hearts"" due to their importance. In combat, Scorbunny run circles around their opponents to bewilder them before delivering burning kicks.  
Trainers that can keep up with these fast-paced Pokémon will find themselves rewarded with their impressive speed and strength.  
",Rabbit Pokémon,fire,1′00″,9.9
raboot,"As shown by Goh's Raboot, this Pokemon is very cool and aloof most of the time. For most times, Raboot prefers putting its paws into its abdomen's fur, in order to prevent heat loss. It kicks berries around with its feet, practicing in order to learn its evolution's signature move, Pyro Ball, before swallowing the berry.
",Rabbit Pokémon,fire,2′00″,19.8
cinderace,"Similarly to Incineroar, Cinderace are very confident and love the spotlight. They also get pumped up when cheered on-but if they get overconfident, they risk getting overtaken and put in a tough spot.
Whether experiencing a victory or loss, they are good sports that can recognize a stronger foe and learn from their mistakes in battle. Trainers that are determined to always strive towards the horizon will find Cinderace to be great partner Pokémon on their journeys. 
",Striker Pokémon,fire,4′07″,72.8
sobble,"Sobble is timid in nature. It will begin crying or turn invisible whenever it is scared, hurt, or threatened.Trainers that do not mind a challenge will be able to handle raising these timid yet clever Pokémon.&#160;
",Water Lizard Pokémon,water,1′00″,8.8
drizzile,"Drizzile are clever and intelligent fighters, yet also very lazy. In combat, Drizzile use water moisture from their palms to create water balloons. To keep enemies out of its territory, Drizzile lay traps around the area using these balloons due to their cautious nature. In fact, they may fill ditches with water and then overlay them with leaves and mud to make them appear solid; enemies trying to approach will try to walk over the ditches only to fall inside. 
When hunting, nonetheless, they can turn from slothful to concentrated. Drizzile prefer to do as little work as possible in order to achieve the results they want, and are known to fool other Pokémon into doing tasks for them. They tend to be asocial and prefer to spend their time in the solitude of tree hollows and rock depressions.
Seen by Goh's Drizzile, despite their solitary and lazy nature they do like to be active when no one else is around or at night. Similar to a Greninja, Lickitung or Kecleon, they too can also use their tongues grab and restrain opponents.  
",Water Lizard Pokémon,water,2′04″,25.4
inteleon,"Inteleon, as the name suggests, are highly intelligent and gentleman Pokémon. One analyses its opponents carefully to discern their weaknesses and then uses its finger to ""snipe"" other Pokémon. They are fiercely loyal to the Trainers they trust.
Though Inteleon prefer to work alone, they are not as asocial as Drizzile. They are rather task-oriented and do not let their personal opinions get in the way of whatever they are trying to accomplish.
",Secret Agent Pokémon,water,6′03″,99.6
skwovet,"Skwovet are very gluttonous and love to eat. In fact, they love to eat so much that they get uneasy if their cheeks are ever empty of Berries. They have a habit of attacking people who try to shake Berry Trees, worried about losing their food. They'll also show up on farms in an effort to collect even more Berries. However, they will become quite distressed should their stomachs and cheek pouches ever feel empty. They are not picky about flavors; from sweet to sour, bitter to spicy, Skwovet will eat any and all Berries they can find growing on trees. Though they prefer ripened Berries, they will not hesitate to nibble hard, unripe ones straight from the branch.
Skwovet are commonplace in Galar, ranging from farms to trees in urban areas.
",Cheeky Pokémon,normal,1′00″,5.5
greedent,"True to their name, Greedent are extremely greedy and gluttonous (hence their plump physique). They store so many berries in their tails that they never notice when they lose them. They're also slow-witted and have a habit of attacking people that shake berry trees too much.
",Greedy Pokémon,normal,2′00″,13.2
rookidee,"Rookidee are fierce and nimble, willing to stand up to opponents much larger than themselves, similarly to their real-world counterpart. these Pokémon learn to adapt their fighting styles to different situations. For instance, Rookidee will use their size and speed to their advantage against bulky opponents, nimbly hopping between their feet to attack weak spots and avoid lumbering strikes. With meeker foes, they will instead try to press the attack to keep them off-balance. They can be a bit too eager when they see supposed openings however, and will often fall for feints. This is perhaps the hardest lesson for them to learn, and trainers may notice their Rookidee making this mistake repeatedly through many battles. It is said that when Rookidee finally learn to be patient and think their opponents' strategies through, they are ready to evolve into Corvisquire.
",Tiny Bird Pokémon,flying,0′08″,4
corvisquire,"Corvisquire are intelligent, shown by their ability to use tools to assist them in battle. They can accurately judge an opponent's strength in order to discern whether it is worth it to challenge the opponent or not.
",Raven Pokémon,flying,2′07″,35.3
corviknight,"Often being seen fearlessly soaring through the air, Corviknight is regarded as the strongest Pokémon living in the skies of the Galar region. With just a sharp glare and cry from this fearsome Pokémon, any Pokémon which are foolish enough to challenge them are sent cowering in tremendous fear.
Corviknight are also intelligent creatures, capable of using tools and solving problems through intuition. These taciturn Pokémon are always keenly observing their surroundings. Corviknight&#160;in fact pay attention to the body language of passerby in order to determine whether they intend to cause trouble before they even pick a fight. In some regions such as Galar, they are employed as taxi Pokémon because of their directional intuition and their stamina. Because of their reputation, Corviknight are commonly used as emblems to represent intellect and power. They also have less of a temper and are thus preferred over Braviary for the Flying Taxi service in Galar.
In Paldea, Corviknight are instead substituted by Squawkabilly as Flying Taxis, as  Corviknight are targeted by its natural predator: Tinkaton who likes to hit them out of the sky with rocks launched from their hammers for fun, which could endanger the driver and passenger(s).
",Raven Pokémon,"flying,steel",7′03″,165.3
blipbug,"Blipbug uses the hairs on its body to gather information about its surroundings, presumably to avoid predators that could easily overpower it since Blipbug is very weak.
",Larva Pokémon,bug,1′04″,17.6
dottler,"Though Blipbug are already skittish Pokémon that spend most of their time in hiding, Dottler take this secrecy even further.Dottler remains stationary awaiting evolution most of the time, using its psychic powers only when necessary.When they sense something abnormal, their dots will begin to blink; this blinking will become faster as enemies approach, and more erratic when Dottler sense especially powerful enemies. If predators do manage to locate them, Dottler will release a burst of psychic energy to stun them before attempting to make their (sluggish) getaways. The longer Dottler go without food or water, the stronger their psychic abilities and thus their detection systems become. In fact, these Pokémon do not eat at all in order to maximize their psychic conditioning and thus hasten their evolutions. 
",Radome Pokémon,"bug,psychic",1′04″,43
orbeetle,"Orbeetle is well known for possessing high amounts of intelligence, which is shown in its huge brain mass. It releases psychic energy to observe its environment, including those six miles away. As soon as they sense danger, they will begin formulating a plan of attack. By the time enemies actually arrive, Orbeetle will have prepared an impenetrable strategy for victory. Orbeetle are also believed to be able to influence the minds of others that are near them. It is said that these Pokémon remember those who had terrorized them as Blipbug and Dottler, and will use their immense intelligence in order to concoct ways to torment them in turn. If a person is ever faced with a problem that seems specifically designed to ruin their day, it is thought that may have unknowingly angered a Blipbug some time in the past.
",Seven Spot Pokémon,"bug,psychic",1′04″,89.9
nickit,"Nickit are cautious Pokémon that steal food from others. They silently raid food stores and take off with their meals, erasing their tracks with their tails and leaving no sign of their presence. They diet on food stolen from other Pokémon and humans, sometimes including Pokémon Eggs. 
Purrloin is their rival, while Boltund is their natural enemy.
",Fox Pokémon,dark,2′00″,19.6
thievul,"Thievul steal food and eggs from their victims, by stalking their victims' scent and leave markings as a reminder for themselves to rob from their targets who are about to loosen up. But they are naturally afraid of Boltund.
Thievul usually diet on Pokémon Eggs, though they also sometimes rob food from humans and other Pokémon.
",Fox Pokémon,dark,3′11″,43.9
gossifleur,"By getting blown in the wind, Gossifleur can travel for long distance in order to land in areas with clean water and air. They can control their directions by twisting their bodies.
",Flowering Pokémon,grass,1′04″,4.9
eldegoss,"Eldegoss disperse the seeds they produce into the wind to help improve soil and give nutrients to other Pokémon.
Eldegoss also shed quite infrequently. As long as they have fresh water and air, they are quite easy to raise due to their easygoing natures and ability to photosynthesize all of the energy they need.
",Cotton Bloom Pokémon,grass,1′08″,5.5
wooloo,"Timid and docile, Wooloo prefer staying in herds and follow their lead. When facing a problem, they would rather roll away as a method to avoid it.
",Sheep Pokémon,normal,2′00″,13.2
dubwool,"Despite having horns, Dubwool doesn't use them in battle, but rather to attract mates.
",Sheep Pokémon,normal,4′03″,94.8
chewtle,"Chewtle snaps at anything in front of it because of an itch of its teething. It is known to attack first with its horn, flinching them before biting down and not letting go. For this reason, they prefer to use their horns first in combat to charge at foes. It is only when they see their enemies flinch and give them an opening that Chewtle will chomp down with all of their might. Both their horns and their shells are rock-hard. However, their huge heads make Chewtle unable to retreat back into their shells like some other chelonian Pokémon. Instead, these Pokémon will choose fighting over hiding when it comes to danger, fearlessly biting those who try to harm them.
These Pokémon are not recommended for beginning or even intermediate trainers. They are extremely hostile and short-tempered, making them a danger to other people and Pokémon. Even a tiny Chewtle can wreak havoc on their surroundings as they chomp down on things while teething. It takes a skilled trainer to properly handle these Pokémon without resulting in injury for themselves or others.
Ponds and rivers usually have common Chewtle sightings.
",Snapping Pokémon,water,1′00″,18.7
drednaw,"Drednaw are very aggressive and tend to bite. Because of this, inexperienced Trainers will not know how to properly train them, so they end up releasing them.
The power of Gigantamaxing has allowed it to stand on its hind legs and become bipedal! From its standing position, it can come crashing down on opposing Pokémon and crush them with its massive body! Drednaw normally keeps its neck retracted within its shell, but when it attacks, it can rapidly shoot its neck out. Its jaws are also incredibly strong, capable of easily biting through huge metal towers. The strength of its jaws combined with the force of its neck gives Drednaw the power to punch a hole through a rocky mountain in a single strike.
",Bite Pokémon,"water,rock",3′03″,254.6
yamper,"Yamper have a habit of chasing running and moving things, ranging from humans and other Pokémon to moving vehicles.
As they can't store much electricity in its organ, this can explain their tendency to roam around with crackling electric sparks.
Yamper follow and obey people only because they want treats, according to their Shield Dex entry. However, this doesn't affect their popularity in Galar as shepherd dogs.
",Puppy Pokémon,electric,1′00″,29.8
boltund,"Boltund are vivacious and loyal creatures. Compared to their pre-evolutions, they become more serious in nature and more able to focus on the tasks at hand. They still retain their playfulness outside of work, however. In some regions, human herders have partnered with Boltund in for millennia. Though their domestication process began long after Herdier, they are just as reliable with proper training and affection.
In the wild, packs of Boltund can be seen zipping across grasslands. They are extremely loyal to one another and will share electricity with tired pack members to rejuvenate them.
They are also vigilant, and serve as a natural enemy of Thievul. They will go out of their ways to track down these secretive Pokémon and stop them from stealing the eggs of other unsuspecting Pokémon.
",Dog Pokémon,electric,3′03″,75
rolycoly,"Rolycoly uses its eye to illuminate the dark caverns it inhabits. The large piece of coal attached to Rolycoly's underside allows for better maneuverability over the roughest of terrains. 
During the past 100 years, Rolycoly helped provide warmth for families living in Galar. Even in modern times, Rolycoly was used for camping outdoors.  
",Coal Pokémon,rock,1′00″,26.5
carkol,"The coal formed from Carkol's body once helped fuel the lives of people living in Galar. They are thrill-seeking Pokémon that enjoy traveling at high speeds.
",Coal Pokémon,"rock,fire",3′07″,172
coalossal,"While a peaceful Pokémon, Coalossal is very protective of the mines it inhabits and will not tolerate anyone who damages them. If it sees anyone who would do such actions, Coalossal will incinerate the offenders with intense flames that can reach over 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.they are exclusively herbivores and lithovores, consuming plant matter and minerals and compressing it within their bodies into hard anthracite.The anthracite that Coalossal produce is valued for its high quality and ease of harvest. However, because Coalossal must eat more in order to produce this high-grade mineral, it is generally not as cost-efficient as harvesting the coal that Carkol produces. Coalossal anthracite still has its uses in applications where high quality is necessary, though.
During battle, Coalossal releases sparks from its coal heap that can scorch the surrounding areas.
Once it Gigantamaxes, Coalossal is capable of generating flames that can burn more than 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit; the flames themselves are fueled by Gigantamax energy. During a terrible snowstorm, Gigantamax Coalossal helped save the many lives of people living in Galar by providing warmth.   
",Coal Pokémon,"rock,fire",9′02″,684.5
applin,"Applin spends the majority of its life cycle living inside an apple, which helps in protecting against natural predators such as bird Pokémon by pretending to be an ordinary apple. 
The apple that Applin lives inside is a food source and emits a flavor that determines how Applin is going to evolve. Without its apple, it will become weakened and vulnerable.
Applin's body fluid allow it to strengthen the apple’s skin and prevent it from rotting.
",Apple Core Pokémon,"grass,dragon",0′08″,1.1
flapple,"Its consumption of a sour apple has cause Flapple to undergo evolution. Its cheek sacs contain acid capable of causing burns and other chemical reactions. It is able to fly by flapping the apple skins and can fold them back to look like an apple.Flapple will hide in the branches of apple trees with their wings folded and their heads down to mimic apples. When unsuspecting bugs fly by, they will dissolve them with their acid before consuming their catches.Though resourceful, they are not particularly aerodynamic and must exert a lot of energy to stay aloft. For this reason, they prefer an ambush strategy when hunting and only fly when they need to relocate in search of better hunting grounds or escape from danger. In some regions, people dilute Flapple acid with water and add spices to create a refreshingly-tart beverage. This beverage can also be fermented to produce an alcoholic variant. 
When exposed to Gigantamax energy, Flapple is able to create large quantities of nectar. It releases a strong scent from its extremely sweet nectar, causing other Pokémon to faint from a single whiff.
",Apple Wing Pokémon,"grass,dragon",1′00″,2.2
appletun,"It wafts a sweet aroma, like Bounsweet. However, it uses the Sweet Scent to lure Bug type Pokémon to eat.These rotund creatures are quite mild-mannered, spending much of their time lazing about in branches or at the base of trees. At a first glance, resting Appletun may seem like sitting ducks when it comes to predators. The very insects they attract to prey on, however, will actually defend Appletun and their delicious nectar fiercely. In some areas, Appletun nectar is harvested and used to bake a variety of different pastries. These sweet treats are especially popular in the autumn.
Its Gigantamax nectar serves as both good offense and defense. The nectar can be used to drown enemies and shield itself from damage.
",Apple Nectar Pokémon,"grass,dragon",1′04″,28.7
silicobra,"While digging, it will swallow at least 17 pounds of sand and store it in its neck pouch.  When it feels threatened, it will spew sand from its nostrils to blind the enemy before retreating to its burrow to hide. They are not very fast, however; prey that manage to flee from these sand blasts can usually make it to safety before Silicobra can catch up. Silicobra with full neck pouches are weighed down even further, ensuring that they will not be able to chase down their quarry. Contrary to popular belief, neither Silicobra nor their evolutions are venomous. 
",Sand Snake Pokémon,ground,7′03″,16.8
sandaconda,"Sandaconda is predatory, as it likes to eat Durant eggs (similarly to Ekans, who likes to eat Pidgey eggs). However, it gets sad and timid if it has an insufficient amount of sand stored up. 
",Sand Snake Pokémon,ground,12′06″,144.4
cramorant,"Cramorant will sometimes swallow anything which can fit in its mouth whether its food or not, only to spit it out in a hurry when it realizes its error. It is also forgetful but will never forget a trainer it grows to trust, though trainers must never try to take any of its food lest they be attacked. Cramorant nest on seaside bluffs in large, raucous colonies. They glide high above the waves in search of fish. When they sense movement beneath, they will dive beak-first to snap up their catches. Cramorant can in fact forcefully dislodge stuck prey to attack; more graphically, they can also regurgitate the partially digested contents of their stomachs. In fact, this is how they feed their young.
",Gulp Pokémon,"flying,water",2′07″,39.7
arrokuda,"Arrokuda are a hardy species that can tolerate both fresh and salt water. Though they seem to prefer the sea, sizable populations can be found in fast-moving rivers and large lakes as well. Arrokuda are notable for their odd hunting strategy; rather than biting prey with their teeth, they instead prefer to skewer them with their closed jaws. Arrokuda will lie in wait until they sense movement before rushing towards the first sign of prey, hoping to impale them on their sharp jaws. Arrokuda are very proud of the sharpness of these structures and will show them off to other Arrokuda to assert dominance. These Pokémon are not the brightest and commonly cause issues for boats when they accidentally pierce holes into their hulls and get stuck. Boats sailing through Arrokuda territory will often have steel-coated hulls for this reason. Anglers will wave wooden planks through the water to entice Arrokuda to skewer themselves onto them, making them easy catches. After Arrokuda eat their fill, their movements slow considerably, and they are content drifting along with the currents. This makes satiated Arrokuda a prime target for hungry Cramorant scanning the water from above.
",Rush Pokémon,water,1′08″,2.2
barraskewda,"Barraskewda attacks by spinning its propeller tail and using the force to charge ahead and ram at its prey, skewering them. Their jaws are very strong, as strong as Steel itself,evidenced by its variety of biting attacks in its movepool. Barraskewda are the bane of fishermen everywhere because of their uncanny habit of stealing hooked fish just before they are reeled in. These hunters are attracted to movement—such as that of a struggling fish—and can swiftly swim in to impale catches right off of their hooks. They also seem to be better at distinguishing moving animate and inanimate objects than Arrokuda. Though they are solitary hunters, multiple Barraskewda attracted to the same large quarry (for instance, a Wailord) can independently skewer the victim to bring it down; they may fight over who gets to claim the carcass afterwards.
",Skewer Pokémon,water,4′03″,66.1
toxel,"At a first glance, it would appear that these baby Pokémon are prime targets for opportunistic predators. Neither skilled at camouflage nor offense, Toxel seem like sitting ducks out in the open grasslands and badlands that they call home. 
However, most Pokémon know to avoid attacking these creatures. Toxel in fact secrete poison from specialized sacs in their bodies through their skin. Even grazing them will lead to numbness, while more serious exposure can lead to paralysis. Most predators learn to stay away from all Toxel after a single unpleasant experience.
As they are neither very fast nor strong, Toxel primarily eat unfortunate insects that stray too close and become immobilized by their poison or electricity. These quadrupedal Pokémon have a charming habit of sitting upright like human infants. They will attempt to toddle around on two legs until they fall over. Even at this young age, Toxel display very apparent differences in personality between individuals. Some Toxel tend to be brash and impulsive, while others are more reserved and cautious. These personality differences appear dictate what form of Toxtricity they will eventually evolve into.
",Baby Pokémon,"electric,poison",1′04″,24.3
toxtricity,"Amped Form Toxtricity are known to be short-tempered and extremely confident. This form aggressively attacks anything that makes eye contact with it. It slowly absorbs stagnant water for the toxin it contains. It then breaks down the poison in order for Amped Form Toxtricity to generate electricity.
Low Key Form Toxtricity are known to be selfish and have a high regard towards its strength. Unlike its Amped form counterpart, Toxtricity prefers to taunt opponents into fighting it when making eye contact with them. It can generate 15,000 volts of electricity. Low Key Toxtricity looks down at anything that would challenge it.
Gigantamax Toxtricity usually attacks with the guitar-shaped electric mass it harnesses.
",Punk Pokémon,"electric,poison",5′03″,88.2
sizzlipede,"Sizzlipede are generalist predators that will hunt anything they can get their claws into. They absorb flammable gases produced by decaying plant matter on the ground and store it within their bodies. They can then ignite this gas to make heat, concentrating it in the yellow rings on their bellies. After Sizzlipede catch prey, they will coil themselves around their meals to simultaneously subdue and cook them. This allows them to go after tougher prey than one would expect for their size. Sizzlipede are voracious eaters that will consume every bit of a catch, but they can subsist off a single good meal for weeks at a time. They can be quite finicky regarding cooking temperatures and pride themselves on being able to cook meals to perfection. Because these invertebrates can generate heat, they can inhabit cold mountains that would be too chilly for other ectotherms. When Sizzlipede run out of gas, they will retreat beneath plant detritus until they finish recharging. These Pokémon compete with Venipede for resources in habitats where they both dwell.
",Radiator Pokémon,"fire,bug",2′04″,2.2
centiskorch,"Whenever Centiskorch flares up, its body temperature can increase to 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. It uses its long body as a whip and catapults forwards at its foes. Centiskorch also possesses sharp fangs. They are known to get in territorial battles with Scolipede. These battles usually end with the victor eating the other. 
When imbued with Gigantamax energy, Centiskorch now radiates a more intense body temperature that increases by 500 degrees Fahrenheit. The intense heat waves that Centiskorch gives off can incinerate foes.    
",Radiator Pokémon,"fire,bug",9′10″,264.6
clobbopus,"Clobbopus are very curious Pokémon. However, their means of learning about the world is to punch things. Additionally, unlike many other Pokémon which are often far smarter than they appear, Clobbopus are only about as smart as a three-year-old, which may be an explanation for some of their behavioral patterns.
",Tantrum Pokémon,fighting,2′00″,8.8
grapploct,"Grapploct apparently enjoy challenging various Pokémon in feats of strength, usually against terrestrial (land living) Pokémon. They returns to the sea after the battle is over.
Grapploct and Golisopod living in Galar appear to be each other's prey, with the winner eating the loser of their brawls.
",Jujitsu Pokémon,fighting,5′03″,86
sinistea,"Sineastea were said to be created when a lonely spirit possessed a cold cup of tea. The tea does not taste good, as it tries to make people drink it, only to be spat out almost immediately. Spinning the swirl on its head makes it dizzy.
",Black Tea Pokémon,ghost,0′04″,0.4
polteageist,"If it gains its Trainer's trust, Polteageist may allow its tea to be sampled. However, anyone who consumes this type of tea in large amounts will have an upset stomach.
Polteageist seeks refuge within hotels and eating establishments, camouflaging itself amongst tableware. It is able to multiple itself via transferring its own powers inside leftover tea. Because of this, Polteageist is often considered to be a pest.
",Black Tea Pokémon,ghost,0′08″,0.9
hatenna,"Hatenna dislike people and live in secluded areas. If one senses emotions, it will scurry and hide. It is because the protrusions on their heads can sense emotions like radars, causing the Pokémon great distress when near sources of passion. This sensory system helps them detect predators who mean them harm well before they draw near. 
Hatenna seem especially sensitive to the feelings of people, and even more so towards hostile emotions. This has historically made them excellent warning systems for other woodland Pokémon to signal the approach of human trappers and hunters. When cornered, these Pokémon will release a burst of psychic energy to stun attackers before fleeing deeper into the wilderness.
Hatenna raised by short-tempered trainers can grow up traumatized and unable to form bonds with others. Even well-meaning, but excitable trainers can cause their Hatenna unnecessary stress. For this reason, trainers seeking to raise these Pokémon must receive a psychiatrist-granted license ensuring their temperamental suitability. Hatenna, once bonded with even-tempered trainers, have a charming tendency to perch themselves of their trainers’ heads.
",Calm Pokémon,psychic,1′04″,7.5
hattrem,"Strong emotions can trigger this Pokémon to go into a violent state, presumably injuring the person feeling these emotions, or possibly worse. Hattrem also dislike noise and will similarly seek out loudmouths and get them to pipe down, with force if necessary. In fact, strong emotions, whether happy or sad ones, can still be deemed as irritating and incredibly noisy to Hattrem.
Some people joke that their moniker “the Serene Pokémon” is quite unfitting for such an irritable species. In fact, they were named this in reference to the quiet, peaceful environments that they create around themselves through such policing action. In regions where Hattrem dominate, other Pokémon live in silent fear of their retribution—though not too much fear, so as to not trigger their dislike of strong emotions. Hattrem in such regions will often be working alongside a powerful Hatterene to rule the entire woodland.
",Serene Pokémon,psychic,2′00″,10.6
hatterene,"Hatterene are very sensitive to noise. If somebody starts being too loud around a Hatterene, it tears them apart. If a forest has no signs of living creatures, it means it is a territory of a Hatterene, who has either decimated or scared off other Pokémon with its violent actions. Anyone who steps into a Hatterene's territory will be blasted by a beam and then slashed to death by its claw, which is enhanced by psychic powers.
Hatterene constantly emit a low-level of psychic energy to induce headaches in strangers that come too close to their territory. Indeed, an unnatural quiet and a tingling sensation in the head is a good sign that a Hatterene is near. Many legends surround these Pokémon and their elusive nature.

impidimp,"Mischievous creatures, Impidimp sneak into households to steal from humans. Similarly, to Shuppet, they feed off of frustration and negative energy, sucking it through its nose. More clever individuals may create roadblocks in woodland paths or move around signposts to disorient and frustrate travelers. Groups of Impidimp can wreak havoc on rural villages by terrorizing townsfolk with tiny inconveniences.
To ward off these troublemakers, homes near woodlands where Impidimp dwell may hang silver talismans on their doorknobs to keep the Pokémon out. Scientific evidence seems to support this practice; while Impidimp are inherently weak to Steel-type attacks, they seem to especially despise pure silver.

If no brass is present, the troopers will panic and may end up following another Pokémon, although such occurrences are extremely rare as the group is extremely tight knit. Falinks can change formations in battle. Falinks will adapt different formations for hunting, defending, scouting, and even resting. The units in each position will hold their shields in different orientations in order to maximize the area protection.
