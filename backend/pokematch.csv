Landorus,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/645/,"From the forces of lightning and wind, it creates energy to give nutrients to the soil and make the land abundant. The energy that comes pouring from its tail increases the nutrition in the soil, making crops grow to great size. From the forces of lightning and wind, it creates energy to give nutrients to the soil and make the land abundant. When the incarnations of wind and of lightning clash, landorus arrives to quell the conflict. After the tempests and thunderbolts abate, the land is sure to be blessed with bountiful harvests. Lands visited by landorus grant such bountiful crops that it has been hailed as “the guardian of the fields.” lands visited by landorus grant such bountiful crops that it has been hailed as “the guardian of the fields.”"

This legendary ice pokémon waits for a hero to fill in the missing parts of its body with truth or ideals. It appears that this pokémon uses its powers over ice to freeze its own body in order to stabilize its cellular structure. It generates a powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body became frozen when the energy leaked out. It can produce ultracold air. Its body is frozen. It generates a powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body became frozen when the energy leaked out. Dwelling within it is a power even greater than that of reshiram or zekrom, but the extreme cold keeps that power bound."
Keldeo,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/647/,"Cobalion, terrakion, and virizion taught this pokémon how to fight. It dashes across the world, seeking more opportunities to further its training. They say that keldeo must survive harsh battles and fully develop the horn on its forehead before this pokémon’s true power will awaken. It crosses the world, running over the surfaces of oceans and rivers. It appears at scenic waterfronts. When it is resolute, its body fills with power and it becomes swifter. Its jumps are then too fast to follow. It crosses the world, running over the surfaces of oceans and rivers. It appears at scenic waterfronts. When it is resolute, its body fills with power and it becomes swifter. Its jumps are then too fast to follow. By blasting water from its hooves, it can glide across water. It excels at using leg moves while battling."
Meloetta,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/648/,"The melodies sung by meloetta have the power to make pokémon that hear them happy or sad. Its melodies are sung with a special vocalization method that can control the feelings of those who hear it. Many famous songs have been inspired by the melodies that meloetta plays. The melodies sung by meloetta have the power to make pokémon that hear them happy or sad. Its melodies are sung with a special vocalization method that can control the feelings of those who hear it."
Genesect,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/649/,"Over 300 million years ago, it was feared as the strongest of hunters. It has been modified by team plasma. This pokémon existed 300 million years ago. Team plasma altered it and attached a cannon to its back. This ancient bug pokémon was altered by team plasma. They upgraded the cannon on its back.

Chespin,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/650/,"Such a thick shell of wood covers its head and back that even a direct hit from a truck wouldn’t faze it. The quills on its head are usually soft. When it flexes them, the points become so hard and sharp that they can pierce rock."
Quilladin,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/651/,"They strengthen their lower bodies by running into one another. They are very kind and won’t start fights. It relies on its sturdy shell to deflect predators’ attacks. It counterattacks with its sharp quills."
Chesnaught,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/652/,"Its tackle is forceful enough to flip a 50-ton tank. It shields its allies from danger with its own body. When it takes a defensive posture with its fists guarding its face, it could withstand a bomb blast."
Fennekin,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/653/,"As it walks, it munches on a twig in place of a snack. It intimidates opponents by puffing hot air out of its ears. Eating a twig fills it with energy, and its roomy ears give vent to air hotter than 390 degrees fahrenheit."
Braixen,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/654/,"When the twig is plucked from its tail, friction sets the twig alight. The flame is used to send signals to its allies. It has a twig stuck in its tail. With friction from its tail fur, it sets the twig on fire and launches into battle."
Delphox,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/655/,"It gazes into the flame at the tip of its branch to achieve a focused state, which allows it to see into the future. Using psychic power, it generates a fiery vortex of 5,400 degrees fahrenheit, incinerating foes swept into this whirl of flame."
Froakie,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/656/,"It protects its skin by covering its body in delicate bubbles. Beneath its happy-go-lucky air, it keeps a watchful eye on its surroundings. It secretes flexible bubbles from its chest and back. The bubbles reduce the damage it would otherwise take when attacked."
Frogadier,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/657/,"It can throw bubble-covered pebbles with precise control, hitting empty cans up to a hundred feet away. Its swiftness is unparalleled. It can scale a tower of more than 2,000 feet in a minute’s time."
Greninja,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/658/,"It creates throwing stars out of compressed water. When it spins them and throws them at high speed, these stars can split metal in two. It appears and vanishes with a ninja’s grace. It toys with its enemies using swift movements, while slicing them with throwing stars of sharpest water."
Bunnelby,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/659/,"It excels at digging holes. Using its ears, it can dig a nest 33 feet deep in one night. They use their large ears to dig burrows. They will dig the whole night through. It’s very sensitive to danger. The sound of corviknight’s flapping will have bunnelby digging a hole to hide underground in moments. It has ears like shovels. Digging holes strengthens its ears so much that they can sever thick roots effortlessly."
Diggersby,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/660/,"With power equal to an excavator, it can dig through dense bedrock. It’s a huge help during tunnel construction. The fur on its belly retains heat exceptionally well. People used to make heavy winter clothing from fur shed by this pokémon. As powerful as an excavator, its ears can reduce dense bedrock to rubble. When it’s finished digging, it lounges lazily. With their powerful ears, they can heft boulders of a ton or more with ease. They can be a big help at construction sites."
Fletchling,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/661/,"Its melodious cries are actually warnings. Fletchling will mercilessly peck at anything that enters its territory. When this pokémon gets excited, its body temperature increases sharply. If you touch a fletchling with bare hands, you might get burned. While it’s an amiable pokémon, if you touch it unexpectedly, it will heat up its body in an instant, and you’ll be burned. Its body is always warm. Trainers who live in cold areas apparently sleep with it in their bed. These friendly pokémon send signals to one another with beautiful chirps and tail-feather movements. This amiable pokémon is easy to train. But when battle is joined, it shows its ferocious side. Despite the beauty of its lilting voice, it’s merciless to intruders that enter its territory. When it’s excited, its temperature can double, spiking hormone production in its body."
Fletchinder,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/662/,"Fletchinder launches embers into the den of its prey. When the prey comes leaping out, fletchinder’s sharp talons finish it off. Its speed right after takeoff already puts it in the top speed class of all bird pokémon. The hotter the flame sac on its belly, the faster it can fly, but it takes some time to get the fire going. From its beak, it expels embers that set the tall grass on fire. Then it pounces on the bewildered prey that pop out of the grass. It scatters embers in the tall grass. Then bug pokémon, frightened by the flames, come flying out, and fletchinder gobbles them up. Fletchinder are exceedingly territorial and aggressive. These pokémon fight among themselves over feeding grounds. From its beak, it fires embers at its prey. Once it has caught them, it grills them at high heat before feasting upon them. It will not tolerate other fletchinder entering its territory, which has a radius of several miles."
Talonflame,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/663/,"Bird pokémon make up most of its diet. It approaches at high speeds and smacks them down to the ground with its powerful kick. Talonflame dives toward prey at speeds of up to 310 mph and assaults them with powerful kicks, giving the prey no chance to escape. When attacking prey, it can reach speeds of up to 310 mph. It finishes its prey off with a colossal kick. It zooms directly at its prey at flight speeds of close to 310 mph, while fiery embers scatter from gaps in its feathers. Its tough wings don’t allow fire to pass through them. A long time ago, firefighters’ outfits were made from talonflame wings. Its favorite foods are wingull and pikipek. It attacks with a powerful kick and grasps them firmly in its talons. Talonflame mainly preys upon other bird pokémon. To intimidate opponents, it sends embers spewing from gaps between its feathers. In the fever of an exciting battle, it showers embers from the gaps between its feathers and takes to the air."
Scatterbug,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/664/,"The powder that covers its body regulates its temperature, so it can live in any region or climate. When under attack from bird pokémon, it spews a poisonous black powder that causes paralysis on contact."
Spewpa,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/665/,"The beaks of bird pokémon can’t begin to scratch its stalwart body. To defend itself, it spews powder. It lives hidden within thicket shadows. When predators attack, it quickly bristles the fur covering its body in an effort to threaten them."
Vivillon,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/666/,"The patterns on this pokémon’s wings depend on the climate and topography of its habitat. It scatters colorful scales. Vivillon with many different patterns are found all over the world. These patterns are affected by the climate of their habitat."
Litleo,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/667/,"They set off on their own from their pride and live by themselves to become stronger. These hot-blooded pokémon are quick to fight. When they’re young, they live with a pride. Once they’re able to hunt prey on their own, they’re kicked out and have to make their own way. The stronger the opponent it faces, the more heat surges from its mane and the more power flows through its body. This hot-blooded pokémon is filled with curiosity. When it gets angry or starts fighting, its short mane gets hot."
Pyroar,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/668/,"The males are usually lazy, but when attacked by a strong foe, a male will protect its friends with no regard for its own safety. With fiery breath of more than 10,000 degrees fahrenheit, they viciously threaten any challenger. The females protect the pride’s cubs. The temperature of its breath is over 10,000 degrees fahrenheit, but pyroar doesn’t use it on its prey. This pokémon prefers to eat raw meat. The male with the largest mane of fire is the leader of the pride."
Flabebe,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/669/,"It’s not safe without the power of a flower, but it will keep traveling around until it finds one with the color and shape it wants. It draws out and controls the hidden power of flowers. The flower flabébé holds is most likely part of its body. When it finds a flower it likes, it dwells on that flower its whole life long. It floats in the wind’s embrace with an untroubled heart. Flabébé wears a crown made from pollen it’s collected from its flower. The crown has hidden healing properties."
Floette,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/670/,"When the flowers of a well-tended flower bed bloom, it appears and celebrates with an elegant dance. It gives its own power to flowers, pouring its heart into caring for them. Floette never forgives anyone who messes up a flower bed. It raises flowers and uses them as weapons. The more gorgeous the blossom, the more power it contains. It flutters around fields of flowers and cares for flowers that are starting to wilt. It draws out the hidden power of flowers to battle."
Florges,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/671/,"In times long past, governors of castles would invite florges to create flower gardens to embellish the castle domains. It controls the flowers it grows. The petal blizzards that florges triggers are overwhelming in their beauty and power. It claims exquisite flower gardens as its territory, and it obtains power from basking in the energy emitted by flowering plants. Its life can span several hundred years. It’s said to devote its entire life to protecting gardens."
Skiddo,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/672/,"Thought to be one of the first pokémon to live in harmony with humans, it has a placid disposition. If it has sunshine and water, it doesn’t need to eat, because it can generate energy from the leaves on its back."
Gogoat,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/673/,"They inhabit mountainous regions. The leader of the herd is decided by a battle of clashing horns. It can tell how its trainer is feeling by subtle shifts in the grip on its horns. This empathic sense lets them run as if one being."
Pancham,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/674/,"It grows up imitating the behavior of pangoro, which it looks up to as a leader. Wanting to make sure it’s taken seriously, pancham’s always giving others a glare. But if it’s not focusing, it ends up smiling. There’s no point to the leaf in its mouth, aside from an effort to look cool. It’s mischievous, so it’s not well suited to inexperienced trainers. It chooses a pangoro as its master and then imitates its master’s actions. This is how it learns to battle and hunt for prey. It’s desperate to intimidate its opponents. Be nice and pretend to be scared if you catch it glaring at you intensely. It does its best to be taken seriously by its enemies, but its glare is not sufficiently intimidating. Chewing on a leaf is its trademark. It follows pangoro around like a henchman. When pancham makes a big mistake, its leaf gets taken away. It does its level best to glare and pull a scary face, but it can’t help grinning if anyone pats its head."
Pangoro,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/675/,"It charges ahead and bashes its opponents like a berserker, uncaring about any hits it might take. Its arms are mighty enough to snap a telephone pole. This rowdy pokémon boasts great physical strength. Many trainers are also smitten by its lively character. Although it possesses a violent temperament, it won’t put up with bullying. It uses the leaf in its mouth to sense the movements of its enemies. This pokémon is quick to anger, and it has no problem using its prodigious strength to get its way. It lives for duels against obstagoon. It boasts superb physical strength. Those who wish to become pangoro’s trainer have no choice but to converse with their fists. From the slight twitches of its bamboo leaf, it deduces its opponent’s movements. It’s eager to tussle but kindhearted toward its companions. Pangoro is the type to talk with its fists. It doesn’t say much as it pummels opponents with enough force to send a dump truck flying. Using its leaf, pangoro can predict the moves of its opponents. It strikes with punches that can turn a dump truck into scrap with just one hit."
Furfrou,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/676/,"There was an era when aristocrats would compete to see who could trim their furfrou’s fur into the most exquisite style. Historically, in the kalos region, these pokémon were the designated guardians of the king. Trimming its fluffy fur not only makes it more elegant but also increases the swiftness of its movements. Left alone, its fur will grow longer and longer, but it will only allow someone it trusts to cut it."
Espurr,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/677/,"Though espurr’s expression never changes, behind that blank stare is an intense struggle to contain its devastating psychic power. It has enough psychic energy to blast everything within 300 feet of itself, but it has no control over its power. There’s enough psychic power in espurr to send a wrestler flying, but because this power can’t be controlled, espurr finds it troublesome. The organ that emits its intense psychic power is sheltered by its ears to keep power from leaking out."
Meowstic,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/678/,"When in danger, it raises its ears and releases enough psychic power to grind a 10-ton truck into dust. The defensive instinct of the males is strong. It’s when they’re protecting themselves or their partners that they unleash their full power. The eyeball patterns on the interior of its ears emit psychic energy. It keeps the patterns tightly covered because that power is too immense. Revealing the eyelike patterns on the insides of its ears will unleash its psychic powers. It normally keeps the patterns hidden, however."
Honedge,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/679/,"If anyone dares to grab its hilt, it wraps a blue cloth around that person’s arm and drains that person’s life energy completely. Apparently this pokémon is born when a departed spirit inhabits a sword. It attaches itself to people and drinks their life force. The blue eye on the sword’s handguard is the true body of honedge. With its old cloth, it drains people’s lives away. Honedge’s soul once belonged to a person who was killed a long time ago by the sword that makes up honedge’s body."
Doublade,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/680/,"The two swords employ a strategy of rapidly alternating between offense and defense to bring down their prey. Honedge evolves into twins. The two blades rub together to emit a metallic sound that unnerves opponents. The complex attack patterns of its two swords are unstoppable, even for an opponent greatly accomplished at swordplay. When honedge evolves, it divides into two swords, which cooperate via telepathy to coordinate attacks and slash their enemies to ribbons."
Aegislash,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/681/,"Its potent spectral powers allow it to manipulate others. It once used its powers to force people and pokémon to build a kingdom to its liking. In this defensive stance, aegislash uses its steel body and a force field of spectral power to reduce the damage of any attack. Generations of kings were attended by these pokémon, which used their spectral power to manipulate and control people and pokémon. Apparently, it can detect the innate qualities of leadership. According to legend, whoever it recognizes is destined to become king."
Spritzee,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/682/,"It emits a scent that enraptures those who smell it. This fragrance changes depending on what it has eaten. A scent pouch within this pokémon’s body allows it to create various scents. A change in its diet will alter the fragrance it produces. In the past, rather than using perfume, royal ladies carried a spritzee that would waft a fragrance they liked. The scent its body gives off enraptures those who smell it. Noble ladies had no shortage of love for spritzee."
Aromatisse,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/683/,"The scent that constantly emits from its fur is so powerful that this pokémon’s companions will eventually lose their sense of smell. It devises various scents, pleasant and unpleasant, and emits scents that its enemies dislike in order to gain an edge in battle. The scents aromatisse can produce range from sweet smells that bolster allies to foul smells that sap an opponent’s will to fight. Its scent is so overpowering that, unless a trainer happens to really enjoy the smell, he or she will have a hard time walking alongside it."
Swirlix,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/684/,"To entangle its opponents in battle, it extrudes white threads as sweet and sticky as cotton candy. It eats its own weight in sugar every day. If it doesn’t get enough sugar, it becomes incredibly grumpy. Because it eats nothing but sweets, its fur is as sticky sweet as cotton candy. The sweet smell of cotton candy perfumes swirlix’s fluffy fur. This pokémon spits out sticky string to tangle up its enemies."
Slurpuff,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/685/,"It can distinguish the faintest of scents. It puts its sensitive sense of smell to use by helping pastry chefs in their work. By taking in a person’s scent, it can sniff out their mental and physical condition. It’s hoped that this skill will have many medical applications. Slurpuff’s fur contains a lot of air, making it soft to the touch and lighter than it looks. Its sense of smell is 100 million times better than a human’s, so even the faintest scent tells it about everything in the area. It’s like it can see with its nose!"
Inkay,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/686/,"Opponents who stare at the flashing of the light-emitting spots on its body become dazed and lose their will to fight. By exposing foes to the blinking of its luminescent spots, inkay demoralizes them, and then it seizes the chance to flee. It draws prey near with its blinking lights and then wraps them up in its long tentacles and holds them in place. When exchanging information with others of its kind, it flashes the light-emitting spots on its body in a complex rhythm. It flashes the light-emitting spots on its body, which drains its opponent’s will to fight. It takes the opportunity to scuttle away and hide. It spins while making its luminescent spots flash. These spots allow it to communicate with others by using different patterns of light."
Malamar,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/687/,"Gazing at its luminescent spots will quickly induce a hypnotic state, putting the observer under malamar’s control. It’s said that malamar’s hypnotic powers played a role in certain history-changing events. It lures its prey close with hypnotic motions, then wraps its tentacles around it before finishing it off with digestive fluids. When it comes to strong hypnosis, there’s an endless number of people who utilize malamar for their nefarious deeds. It flashes the pattern on its torso to control its prey and draw them in. The edges of its fins are supremely sharp. It wields the most compelling hypnotic powers of any pokémon, and it forces others to do whatever it wants."
Binacle,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/688/,"Two binacle live together on one rock. When they fight, one of them will move to a different rock. They stretch and then contract, yanking their rocks along with them in bold hops. They eat seaweed that washes up on the shoreline. If the two don’t work well together, both their offense and defense fall apart. Without good teamwork, they won’t survive. After two binacle find a suitably sized rock, they adhere themselves to it and live together. They cooperate to gather food during high tide."
Barbaracle,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/689/,"Barbaracle’s legs and hands have minds of their own, and they will move independently. But they usually follow the head’s orders. Having an eye on each palm allows it to keep watch in all directions. In a pinch, its limbs start to act on their own to ensure the enemy’s defeat. When they evolve, two binacle multiply into seven. They fight with the power of seven binacle. Seven binacle come together to form one barbaracle. The binacle that serves as the head gives orders to those serving as the limbs."
Skrelp,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/690/,"Skrelp looks like a piece of rotten seaweed, so it can blend in with seaweed drifting on the ocean and avoid being detected by enemies. It drifts in the ocean, blending in with floating seaweed. When other pokémon come to feast on the seaweed, skrelp feasts on them instead. It looks just like rotten kelp. It hides from foes while storing up power for its evolution. It vanishes into seaweed and remains perfectly still to avoid attacks from large pokémon. Rotten seaweed is its main food source. Camouflaged as rotten kelp, they spray liquid poison on prey that approaches unawares and then finish it off. It’s not good at swimming, so it clings to the seaweed. In the alola region, it’s often found near dhelmise."
Dragalge,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/691/,"It blends in with seaweed to ambush its prey and then takes them down with a poisonous liquid strong enough to melt metal. Dragalge generates dragon energy by sticking the plume on its head out above the ocean’s surface and bathing it in sunlight. Their poison is strong enough to eat through the hull of a tanker, and they spit it indiscriminately at anything that enters their territory. Tales are told of ships that wander into seas where dragalge live, never to return. Dragalge uses a poisonous liquid capable of corroding metal to send tankers that enter its territory to the bottom of the sea. This vicious pokémon sprays a poisonous liquid on opponents that come near. For whatever reason, it gets along really well with dhelmise."
Clauncher,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/692/,"It moves around by jetting water from its right pincer. It has a poor sense of balance, so it’s terrible at swimming straight. By detonating gas that accumulates in its right claw, this pokémon launches water like a bullet. This is how clauncher defeats its enemies. Its claws occasionally fall off, and it keeps a low profile until they grow back. The meat of its claws is so delicious! Through controlled explosions of internal gas, it can expel water like a pistol shot. At close distances, it can shatter rock. Clauncher’s claws can fall off during battle, but they’ll regenerate. The meat inside the claws is popular as a delicacy in galar. They knock down flying prey by firing compressed water from their massive claws like shooting a pistol."
Clawitzer,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/693/,"Clawitzer’s right arm is a cannon that launches projectiles made of seawater. Shots from a clawitzer’s cannon arm can sink a tanker. It compresses the water it has sucked up and then projects it with enough power to punch a hole right through a thick sheet of iron. After using the feelers on its oversized claw to detect the location of prey, clawitzer launches a cannonball of water at its target. Its right arm is packed with meat. When its pincer falls off, it’s exported to be used as a cooking ingredient. Their enormous claws launch cannonballs of water powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls. By expelling water from the nozzle in the back of its claw, it can move at a speed of 60 knots."
Helioptile,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/694/,"They make their home in deserts. They can generate their energy from basking in the sun, so eating food is not a requirement. The sun powers this pokémon’s electricity generation. Interruption of that process stresses helioptile to the point of weakness. When spread, the frills on its head act like solar panels, generating the power behind this pokémon’s electric moves. The frills on either side of its head have cells that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight."
Heliolisk,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/695/,"It stimulates its muscles with electricity, boosting the strength in its legs and enabling it to run 100 yards in five seconds. A now-vanished desert culture treasured these pokémon. Appropriately, when heliolisk came to the galar region, treasure came with them. They flare their frills and generate energy. A single heliolisk can generate sufficient electricity to power a skyscraper. One heliolisk basking in the sun with its frill outspread is all it would take to produce enough electricity to power a city."
Tyrunt,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/696/,"This is an ancient pokémon, revived in modern times. It has a violent disposition, and it’ll tear apart anything it gets between its hefty jaws. Its large jaw has incredible destructive power. Some theories suggest that its restored form is different from its form of long ago. This pokémon is selfish and likes to be pampered. It can also inflict grievous wounds on its trainer just by playing around. Tyrunt is spoiled and selfish. It may just be trying to frolic, but sometimes the ones it’s trying to frolic with are gravely injured. Its immense jaws have enough destructive force that it can chew up an automobile. It lived 100 million years ago. This pokémon was restored from a fossil. If something happens that it doesn’t like, it throws a tantrum and runs wild."
Tyrantrum,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/697/,"Thanks to its gargantuan jaws, which could shred thick metal plates as if they were paper, it was invincible in the ancient world it once inhabited. A single bite of tyrantrum’s massive jaws will demolish a car. This pokémon was the king of the ancient world. Complete restoration is impossible, allowing room for theories that its entire body was once covered in a feather-like coat. The king of the ancient world, it can easily crunch a car with the devastating strength of its enormous jaws. Nothing could stop this pokémon 100 million years ago, so it behaved like a king. This pokémon is from about 100,000,000 years ago. It has the presence of a king, vicious but magnificent."
Amaura,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/698/,"This pokémon was successfully restored from a fossil. In the past, it lived with others of its kind in cold lands where there were fewer predators. This calm pokémon lived in a cold land where there were no violent predators like tyrantrum. Amaura was restored successfully, but it’s not expected to live long because of the heat of the current environment. Amaura is an ancient pokémon that has gone extinct. Specimens of this species can sometimes be found frozen in ice. This ancient pokémon was restored from part of its body that had been frozen in ice for over 100 million years. It lived in cold areas in ancient times. It’s said that when amaura whinnies, auroras appear in the night sky."
Aurorus,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/699/,"This usually quiet and kindly pokémon has a surface temperature of around –240 degrees fahrenheit. The diamond-shaped crystals on its body expel air as cold as -240 degrees fahrenheit, surrounding its enemies and encasing them in ice. When gripped by rage, aurorus will emanate freezing air, covering everything around it in ice. An aurorus was found frozen solid within a glacier, just as it appeared long ago, which became quite a big event in the news. Aurorus was restored from a fossil. It’s said that when this pokémon howls, auroras appear in the night sky. Using its diamond-shaped crystals, it can instantly create a wall of ice to block an opponent’s attack."
Sylveon,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/700/,"When this pokémon sights its prey, it swirls its ribbonlike feelers as a distraction. A moment later, it pounces. By releasing enmity-erasing waves from its ribbonlike feelers, sylveon stops any conflict. It wraps its ribbonlike feelers around the arm of its beloved trainer and walks with him or her. Once a fight breaks out, it will unflinchingly charge at dragon pokémon that are many times larger than itself. Sylveon wraps its ribbonlike feelers around its trainer’s arm because this touch enables it to read its trainer’s feelings. Its ribbonlike feelers give off an aura that weakens hostility in its prey, causing them to let down their guard. Then it attacks. There’s a galarian fairy tale that describes a beautiful sylveon vanquishing a dreadful dragon pokémon. It emits a soothing aura from its ribbon-shaped organs. It wraps these appendages around quarrelers to instantly restore calm to the situation. It sends a soothing aura from its ribbonlike feelers to calm fights."
Hawlucha,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/701/,"It always strikes a pose before going for its finishing move. Sometimes opponents take advantage of that time to counterattack. Although its body is small, its proficient fighting skills enable it to keep up with big bruisers like machamp and hariyama. With its wings, it controls its position in the air. It likes to attack from above, a maneuver that is difficult to defend against. It drives its opponents to exhaustion with its agile maneuvers, then ends the fight with a flashy finishing move. It overwhelms opponents with quick moves, but sometimes it showboats for too long when it’s using a special move and gets itself into a pinch. In combat, hawlucha leaps nimbly about, taking advantage of its opponents’ blind spots. It’s also skilled at using superb submission holds."
Dedenne,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/702/,"A dedenne’s whiskers pick up electrical waves other dedenne send out. These pokémon share locations of food or electricity with one another. Since dedenne can’t generate much electricity on its own, it steals electricity from outlets or other electric pokémon. It sneaks into people’s homes and steals electricity from their outlets. When your electric bill seems off, it’s the handiwork of this rascal. Its whiskers serve as antennas. By sending and receiving electrical waves, it can communicate with others over vast distances. It uses its tail to absorb electricity from power plants or from outlets in houses, and then it fires the electricity from its whiskers. Its upper whiskers are sensors that survey its surroundings. Its lower whiskers are organs that shoot electricity."
Carbink,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/703/,"It’s said that somewhere in the world, there’s a mineral vein housing a large pack of slumbering carbink. It’s also said that this pack has a queen. It has slept underground for hundreds of millions of years since its birth. It’s occasionally found during the excavation of caves. When beset by attackers, carbink wipes them all out by firing high-energy beams from the gems embedded in its body. Although this pokémon is not especially rare, its glittering, jewel-draped body draws attention from people. Born from the high temperatures and pressures deep underground, it defends itself by firing beams from the jewel part of its body. To keep the jewels on their bodies free of tarnish, packs of carbink use their soft manes to polish one another’s jewels. Born from the temperatures and pressures deep underground, it fires beams from the stone in its head. Some say that deep beneath the surface of the world, a pack of carbink live with their queen in a kingdom of jewels."
Goomy,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/704/,"The weakest dragon-type pokémon, it lives in damp, shady places, so its body doesn’t dry out.', 'Goomy hides away in the shade of trees, where it's nice and humid. If the slime coating its body dries out, the pokémon instantly becomes lethargic.', 'it uses its horns to check out its surroundings. They’re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it will feel a strong shock and be unable to move. Its body is mostly water. If it dries out, it will die, so it’s always sitting with perfect stillness in the shade. The weakest of all dragon-type pokémon, it’s unable to breathe if its skin dries out, so it sticks to shady places. Their horns are powerful sensors. As soon as goomy pick up any sign of enemies, they go into hiding. This is how they’ve survived. Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden mucous membrane. Anyone who touches it needs some thorough hand-washing. It’s covered in a slimy membrane that makes any punches or kicks slide off it harmlessly. Because most of its body is water, it will dry up if the weather becomes too arid. It’s considered the weakest dragon pokémon."
Sliggoo,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/705/,"This pokémon’s mucous can dissolve anything. Toothless, it sprays mucous on its prey. Once they’re nicely dissolved, it slurps them up. Its four horns are a high-performance radar system. It uses them to sense sounds and smells, rather than using ears or a nose. Its entire body is covered with gooey mucus that can dissolve anything. Be sure to put gloves on if you’re going to touch it. It drives away opponents by excreting a sticky liquid that can dissolve anything. Its eyes devolved, so it can’t see anything. The lump on its back contains its tiny brain. It thinks only of food and escaping its enemies. It crawls along sluggishly. The swirly protrusion on its back is filled with its brain and other organs. It has trouble drawing a line between friends and food. It will calmly try to melt and eat even those it gets along well with. Although this pokémon isn’t very strong, its body is coated in a caustic slime that can melt through anything, so predators steer clear of it.', 'A creature given to melancholy. I suspect its metallic shell developed as a result of the mucus on its skin reacting with the iron in hisui's water."
Goodra,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/706/,"Underneath its slimy skin is a thick layer of fat, and the combination of the two makes enemies’ attacks slide right off. It attacks with retractable horns. It throws a punch that’s the equivalent of the force of a hundred pro boxers. This very friendly dragon-type pokémon will hug its beloved trainer, leaving that trainer covered in sticky slime. An amazingly friendly pokémon, but if left to itself, loneliness overcomes it, and it oozes gooey tears. Able to freely control the hardness of its metallic shell. It loathes solitude and is extremely clingy—it will fume and run riot if those dearest to it ever leave its side. It gets picked on because it’s meek. But then, whoever teased it gets to feel the full force of its horns and a good swatting from its thick tail. Sometimes it misunderstands instructions and appears dazed or bewildered. Many trainers don’t mind, finding this behavior to be adorable. It’s very friendly toward people. If you grow close to it, goodra will hug you with its sticky, slime-covered body. Don’t get mad. Its form of offense is forcefully stretching out its horns. The strikes land 100 times harder than any blow from a heavyweight boxer."
Klefki,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/707/,"Although it’s unclear why it collects keys, giving it a key makes klefki very happy. However, it apparently only likes master keys. Klefki sucks in metal ions with the horn topping its head. It seems this pokémon loves keys so much that its head needed to look like one, too. It never lets go of a key that it likes, so people give it the keys to vaults and safes as a way to prevent crime. This pokémon is constantly collecting keys. Entrust a klefki with important keys, and the pokémon will protect them no matter what. This even-tempered pokémon has a habit of collecting keys. It will sneak into people’s homes to steal their keys. These key collectors threaten any attackers by fiercely jingling their keys at them. Long ago it lived in mines, but once the minerals that make up its diet became scarcer, klefki began appearing in human settlements. It inserts its horn into chinks in metal, absorbing metal ions. For some reason, it collects keys."
Phantump,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/708/,"According to legend, medicine to cure any illness can be made by plucking the green leaves on its head, brewing them, and boiling down the liquid. By imitating the voice of a child, it causes people to get hopelessly lost deep in the forest. It’s trying to make friends with them. These pokémon are stumps possessed by the spirits of children who died in the forest. Their cries sound like eerie screams. After a lost child perished in the forest, their spirit possessed a tree stump, causing the spirit’s rebirth as this pokémon. These pokémon are created when spirits possess rotten tree stumps. They prefer to live in abandoned forests. An unknown spirit came to lodge in a tree stump, creating this pokémon. A cure-all can be made from an infusion of its green leaves. According to old tales, these pokémon are stumps possessed by the spirits of children who died while lost in the forest. With a voice like a human child’s, it cries out to lure adults deep into the forest, getting them lost among the trees."
Trevenant,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/709/,"Using its roots as a nervous system, it controls the trees in the forest. It’s kind to the pokémon that reside in its body. It can control trees at will. It will trap people who harm the forest, so they can never leave. It’s feared as a ghost of the forest. Lumberjacks bring along fire types, which trevenant hates, when they enter the forest. Small roots that extend from the tips of this pokémon’s feet can tie into the trees of the forest and give trevenant control over them. This pokémon controls trees via roots stretching from its feet, and it will attack anyone that dares to ravage the forest. Through its roots, it exerts control over other trees. A deadly curse falls upon anyone cutting down trees in forests where trevenant dwell. People fear it due to a belief that it devours any who try to cut down trees in its forest, but to the pokémon it shares its woods with, it’s kind. This pokémon is said to devour anyone daring to ravage the forest. To the creatures dwelling in the forest, it offers great kindness."
Pumpkaboo,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/710/,"It is said to carry wandering spirits to the place where they belong so they can move on. The pumpkin body is inhabited by a spirit trapped in this world. As the sun sets, it becomes restless and active. The light that streams out from the holes in the pumpkin can hypnotize and control the people and pokémon that see it. Spirits that wander this world are placed into pumpkaboo’s body. They’re then moved on to the afterlife."
Gourgeist,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/711/,"Eerie cries emanate from its body in the dead of night. The sounds are said to be the wails of spirits who are suffering in the afterlife. It enwraps its prey in its hairlike arms. It sings joyfully as it observes the suffering of its prey. Singing in eerie voices, they wander town streets on the night of the new moon. Anyone who hears their song is cursed. In the darkness of a new-moon night, gourgeist will come knocking. Whoever answers the door will be swept off to the afterlife."
Bergmite,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/712/,"It blocks opponents’ attacks with the ice that shields its body. It uses cold air to repair any cracks with new ice. Using air of -150 degrees fahrenheit, they freeze opponents solid. They live in herds above the snow line on mountains. This pokémon lives in areas of frigid cold. It secures itself to the back of an avalugg by freezing its feet in place. Lives on mountains blanketed in perennial snow. It freezes water vapor in the air to make the ice helmet that it dons for defense. They chill the air around them to −150 degrees fahrenheit, freezing the water in the air into ice that they use as armor."
Avalugg,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/713/,"At high latitudes, this pokémon can be found with clusters of bergmite on its back as it swims among the icebergs. The way several bergmite huddle on its back makes it look like an aircraft carrier made of ice. Its ice-covered body is as hard as steel. Its cumbersome frame crushes anything that stands in its way. As avalugg moves about during the day, the cracks in its body deepen. The pokémon’s body returns to a pristine state overnight. The armor of ice covering its lower jaw puts steel to shame and can shatter rocks with ease. This pokémon barrels along steep mountain paths, cleaving through the deep snow."
Noibat,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/714/,"Even a robust wrestler will become dizzy and unable to stand when exposed to its 200,000-hertz ultrasonic waves. Fruits are its favorite foods. This gourmet carefully picks out just the ripe ones using its sonar. No wavelength of sound is beyond noibat’s ability to produce. The ultrasonic waves it generates can overcome much larger pokémon. It flies around in search of fruit to eat. It uses ultrasonic waves to detect which fruits are ripe. They live in pitch-black caves. Their enormous ears can emit ultrasonic waves of 200,000 hertz. After nightfall, they emerge from the caves they nest in during the day. Using their ultrasonic waves, they go on the hunt for ripened fruit."
Noivern,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/715/,"Although it has a violent disposition, if you give it a nice ripe fruit that it loves, noivern will suddenly become tame. This hot-blooded pokémon attacks anything it sees with ultrasonic waves that can crush boulders. Aggressive and cruel, this pokémon will ruthlessly torment enemies that are helpless in the dark. Flying through the darkness, it weakens enemies with ultrasonic waves that could crush stone. Its fangs finish the fight.

Yveltal,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/717/,"When its life comes to an end, it absorbs the life energy of every living thing and turns into a cocoon once more. When this legendary pokémon’s wings and tail feathers spread wide and glow red, it absorbs the life force of living creatures."
Zygarde,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/718/,"It’s hypothesized that it’s monitoring those who destroy the ecosystem from deep in the cave where it lives. This is zygarde’s form when it has gathered 50% of its cells. It wipes out all those who oppose it, showing not a shred of mercy. It’s thought to be monitoring the ecosystem. There are rumors that even greater power lies hidden within it. When the kalos region’s ecosystem falls into disarray, it appears and reveals its secret power. Some say it can change to an even more powerful form when battling those who threaten the ecosystem. This is zygarde’s form when about half of its pieces have been assembled. It plays the role of monitoring the ecosystem."
Diancie,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/719/,"It can instantly create many diamonds by compressing the carbon in the air between its hands. A sudden transformation of carbink, its pink, glimmering body is said to be the loveliest sight in the whole world."

Rowlet,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/722/,"During the day, it builds up energy via photosynthesis. At night, it flies silently through the sky, on the prowl for prey. At a distance, it launches its sharp feathers while flying about. If the enemy gets too close, rowlet switches tactics and delivers vicious kicks. Silently it glides, drawing near its targets. Before they even notice it, it begins to pelt them with vicious kicks. It sends its feathers, which are as sharp as blades, flying in attack. Its legs are strong, so its kicks are also formidable. This wary pokémon uses photosynthesis to store up energy during the day, while becoming active at night. Flies noiselessly on delicate wings. It has mastered the art of deftly launching dagger-sharp feathers from those same wings. It feels relaxed in tight, dark places and has been known to use its trainer’s pocket or bag as a nest."
Dartrix,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/723/,"It never slacks when it comes to the task of cleaning its feathers. Thorough preening keeps it looking spiffy and its blade quills nice and sharp. Regularly basks in sunlight to gather power—presumably due to the frigid climate. Nonetheless, the edges of the blade quills set into its wings are keen as ever. A bit of a dandy, it spends its free time preening its wings. Its preoccupation with any dirt on its plumage can leave it unable to battle. It throws sharp feathers called blade quills at enemies or prey. It seldom misses. This narcissistic pokémon is a clean freak. If you don’t groom it diligently, it will stop listening to you. It throws one knifelike feather after another at its enemies, and each one precisely strikes a weak point. These feathers are known as blade quills. Supremely sensitive to the presence of others, it can detect opponents standing behind it, flinging its sharp feathers to take them out."
Decidueye,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/724/,"As if wielding a bow, it launches the arrow quills hidden among the feathers of its wings. Decidueye’s shots never miss. In a tenth of a second, it can nock and fire an arrow quill, piercing an opponent’s weak point before they notice what’s happening. Although basically cool and cautious, when it’s caught by surprise, it’s seized by panic. It nocks its arrow quills and shoots them at opponents. When it simply can’t afford to miss, it tugs the vine on its head to improve its focus.', 'The air stored inside the rachises of decidueye's feathers insulates the pokémon against hisui's extreme cold. This is firm proof that evolution can be influenced by environment.', 'it fires arrow quills from its wings with such precision, they can pierce a pebble at distances over a hundred yards. Decidueye can nock and fire an arrow at an enemy in a tenth of a second, so its battles are decided in the blink of an eye."
Litten,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/725/,"If you try too hard to get close to it, it won’t open up to you. Even if you do grow close, giving it too much affection is still a no-no. It spends even the smallest amount of downtime grooming its fur with its tongue. Loose fur gathers in its stomach and serves as fuel for fiery moves. Its coat regrows twice a year. When the time comes, litten sets its own body on fire and burns away the old fur. It doesn’t allow its emotions to be easily seen. Earning its trust takes time. It prefers solitude. Trying to pet litten before it trusts you will result in a nasty scratch from its sharp claws. Be careful. While grooming itself, it builds up fur inside its stomach. It sets the fur alight and spews fiery attacks, which change based on how it coughs."
Torracat,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/726/,"It boasts powerful front legs. With a single punch, it can bend an iron bar right over. When its mane is standing on end, you can tell it’s feeling good. When it isn’t feeling well, its fur will lie down flat. When facing a powerful enemy, torracat’s fighting spirit gets pumped up, and its fire bell blazes hotter.

It excels at violent, no-holds-barred battles. The temperature of the flames that issue from its navel exceeds 3,600 degrees fahrenheit. When its fighting spirit is set alight, the flames around its waist become especially intense. Although it’s rough mannered and egotistical, it finds beating down unworthy opponents boring. It gets motivated for stronger opponents. This pokémon has a violent, selfish disposition. If it’s not in the mood to listen, it will ignore its trainer’s orders with complete nonchalance. Incineroar’s rough and aggressive behavior is its most notable trait, but the way it helps out small pokémon shows that it has a kind side as well."
Popplio,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/728/,"It creates special bouncy balloons to send at its opponents. When the balloons pop, the sheer force of their bursting is what deals damage.

It attacks by smacking its enemies with the exploding water balloons that it creates."
Primarina,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/730/,"It controls its water balloons with song. The melody is learned from others of its kind and is passed down from one generation to the next. Also known as a songstress, it has a fantastical look on moonlit nights when it leads its colony in song. Its singing voice is its chief weapon in battle. This pokémon’s trainer must prioritize the daily maintenance of its throat at all costs. With its mouth, it makes sonic waves that sound like beautiful singing.

Within its beak, its internal gas ignites, explosively launching seeds with enough power to pulverize boulders. Known for forming harmonious couples, this pokémon is brought to wedding ceremonies as a good luck charm. They smack beaks with others of their kind to communicate. The strength and number of hits tell each other how they feel."
Yungoos,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/734/,"It wanders around in a never-ending search for food. At dusk, it collapses from exhaustion and falls asleep on the spot. Although it will eat anything, it prefers fresh living things, so it marches down streets in search of prey. Its stomach takes up most of its long torso. It’s a big eater, so the amount trainers have to spend on its food is no laughing matter. With its sharp fangs, it will bite anything. It did not originally live in alola but was imported from another region."
Gumshoos,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/735/,"Patient by nature, this pokémon loses control of itself and pounces when it spots its favorite meal—rattata! Although it wasn’t originally found in alola, this pokémon was brought over a long time ago when there was a huge rattata outbreak. It adores having rattata and raticate for dinner, but as it’s diurnal, it never encounters them. This pokémon boasts incredible patience. When it finds a trace of its prey, it patiently stakes out the location...But it’s always snoozing by nightfall."
Grubbin,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/736/,"It uses its big jaws to dig nests into the forest floor, and it loves to feed on sweet tree sap. Its strong jaw enables it to scrape trees and slurp out the sap. It normally lives underground. It spits a sticky thread to stop opponents in their tracks, and then it grabs them in its sharp, sturdy mandibles to take them down. Its natural enemies, like rookidee, may flee rather than risk getting caught in its large mandibles that can snap thick tree branches. They often gather near places frequented by electric pokémon in order to avoid being attacked by bird pokémon. If you find its nest, you shouldn’t stick your hand inside. You’ll get bitten by an irritated grubbin."
Charjabug,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/737/,"While its durable shell protects it from attacks, charjabug strikes at enemies with jolts of electricity discharged from the tips of its jaws. Its body is capable of storing electricity. On camping trips, people are grateful to have one around. Its digestive processes convert the leaves it eats into electricity. An electric sac in its belly stores the electricity for later use. It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely moves, munching away on humus. If you accidentally step on one, you’ll get a shock! Its stout shell provides excellent defense from attacks. It uses electricity on persistent opponents. From the food it digests, it generates electricity, and it stores this energy in its electric sac."
Vikavolt,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/738/,"If it carries a charjabug to use as a spare battery, a flying vikavolt can rapidly fire high-powered beams of electricity. It produces electricity via an electrical organ in its abdomen. It overwhelms bird pokémon with shocking beams of electrical energy. It zips around, on sharp lookout for an opening. It concentrates electrical energy within its large jaws and uses it to zap its enemies. Vikavolt flusters opponents with acrobatic flying maneuvers. This creates an opening for it to deliver an electric beam attack. It builds up electricity in its abdomen, focuses it through its jaws, and then fires the electricity off in concentrated beams. It has an organ that generates electricity in its abdomen. It concentrates energy in its strong jaws and fires off powerful jolts of electricity."
Crabrawler,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/739/,"While guarding its weak points with its pincers, it looks for an opening and unleashes punches. When it loses, it foams at the mouth and faints. Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense and defense. Fights between two crabrawler are like boxing matches. It punches so much, its pincers often come off from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What little meat they contain is rich and delicious. Crabrawler has been known to mistake exeggutor for a coconut tree and climb it. The enraged exeggutor shakes it off and stomps it."
Crabominable,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/740/,"It just throws punches indiscriminately. In times of desperation, it can lop off its own pincers and fire them like rockets. It aimed for the top but got lost and ended up on a snowy mountain. Being forced to endure the cold, this pokémon evolved and grew fur. Before it stops to think, it just starts pummeling.

It skillfully reads those auras to predict its foes’ movements and make fools of them. Myriads of cutiefly flutter above the heads of people who have auras resembling those of flowers. An opponent’s aura can tell cutiefly what that opponent’s next move will be. Then cutiefly can glide around the attack and strike back."
Ribombee,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/743/,"Rain makes pollen damp, so ribombee hates rain. When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a hollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still. It can predict the weather from moisture levels and wind direction. Ribombee only reveals itself when there are a few clear days in a row. Ribombee absolutely hate getting wet or rained on. In the cloudy galar region, they are very seldom seen. It rolls up pollen into puffs. It makes many different varieties, some used as food and others used in battle. It makes pollen puffs from pollen and nectar. The puffs’ effects depend on the type of ingredients and how much of each one is used. Some of ribombee’s pollen puffs are highly nutritious. They are sometimes sold as supplements."
Rockruff,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/744/,"It’s considered to be a good pokémon for beginners because of its friendliness, but its disposition grows rougher as it grows up. As they develop, their disposition grows more violent and aggressive. Many trainers find them too much to handle and abandon them. When it rubs the rocks on its neck against you, that’s proof of its love for you. However, the rocks are sharp, so the gesture is quite painful! This pokémon has lived with people since times long ago. It can sense when its trainer is in the dumps and will stick close by its trainer’s side. This pokémon can bond very strongly with its trainer, but it also has a habit of biting. Raising a rockruff for a long time can be challenging. This pokémon intimidates opponents by striking the ground with the rocks on its neck. The moment an opponent flinches, rockruff attacks."
Lycanroc,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/745/,"Its quick movements confuse its enemies. Well equipped with claws and fangs, it also uses the sharp rocks in its mane as weapons. With swift movements, this pokémon gradually backs its prey into a corner. Lycanroc’s fangs are always aimed toward opponents’ weak spots. When properly raised from a young age, it will become a trustworthy partner that will absolutely never betray its trainer. This lycanroc is calm and cautious. The rocks jutting from its mane are razor sharp. The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives. Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees before finishing them off. The rocks in its mane are sharper than a knife. Fragments that break off are treasured as good luck charms."
Wishiwashi,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/746/,"When it’s in trouble, its eyes moisten and begin to shine. The shining light attracts its comrades, and they stand together against their enemies. It’s awfully weak and notably tasty, so everyone is always out to get it. As it happens, anyone trying to bully it receives a painful lesson. When it’s in a jam, its shining eyes attract others of its kind. The light from its eyes is visible almost 25 miles away. Individually, they’re incredibly weak. It’s by gathering up into schools that they’re able to confront opponents. They’re weak, so they move in schools. However, they can also often be seen all alone, having strayed from the school. When it senses danger, its eyes tear up. The sparkle of its tears signals other wishiwashi to gather."
Mareanie,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/747/,"They eat corsola branches, so mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with corsola branches that have naturally fallen off. The first symptom of its sting is numbness. The next is an itching sensation so intense that it’s impossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin. It’s found crawling on beaches and seafloors. The coral that grows on corsola’s head is as good as a five-star banquet to this pokémon. It plunges the poison spike on its head into its prey. When the prey has weakened, mareanie deals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles. Aside from its head, its body parts regenerate quickly if they’re cut off. After a good night’s sleep, mareanie is back to normal. Unlike their alolan counterparts, the mareanie of the galar region have not yet figured out that the branches of corsola are delicious."
Toxapex,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/748/,"To attack, this pokémon sends toxic spikes flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get mown down by the claws on its feet. With its 12 legs, it creates a dome to shelter within. The flow of the tides doesn’t affect toxapex in there, so it’s very comfortable. Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so toxic that pokémon as large as wailord will still be suffering three days after it first takes effect. Toxapex crawls along the ocean floor on its 12 legs. It leaves a trail of corsola bits scattered in its wake. Those attacked by toxapex’s poison will suffer intense pain for three days and three nights. Post-recovery, there will be some aftereffects. To survive in the cold waters of galar, this pokémon forms a dome with its legs, enclosing its body so it can capture its own body heat."
Mudbray,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/749/,"It has a stubborn, individualistic disposition. Eating dirt, making mud, and playing in the mire all form part of its daily routine. Possessing mighty power, mudbray can be loaded with 50 times its own body weight and will be totally fine. It loves playing in the mud. If it isn’t showered with mud on a daily basis, it gets stressed out and stops listening to its trainer. Loads weighing up to 50 times as much as its own body weight pose no issue for this pokémon. It’s skilled at making use of mud. It eats dirt to create mud and smears this mud all over its feet, giving them the grip needed to walk on rough terrain without slipping. The mud stuck to mudbray’s hooves enhances its grip and its powerful running gait."
Mudsdale,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/750/,"Its heavy, mud-covered kicks are its best means of attack, and it can reduce large trucks to scrap without breaking a sweat. It remains calm and unmoving no matter the situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its mouth to make a special kind of mud. Mud that hardens around a mudsdale’s legs sets harder than stone. It’s so hard that it allows this pokémon to scrap a truck with a single kick. It can trudge mountain roads without rest for three days and three nights, all the while dragging a 10-ton load. It spits a mud that provides resistance to both wind and rain, so the walls of old houses were often coated with it. Mudsdale has so much stamina that it could carry over 10 tons across the galar region without rest or sleep."
Dewpider,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/751/,"It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in water, so it wears a water bubble on its head when it walks around on land. When it comes across enemies or potential prey, this pokémon smashes its water-bubble-covered head into them. It crawls onto the land in search of food. Its water bubble allows it to breathe and protects its soft head. It forms a water bubble at the rear of its body and then covers its head with it. Meeting another dewpider means comparing water-bubble sizes. Dewpider normally lives underwater. When it comes onto land in search of food, it takes water with it in the form of a bubble on its head. When two dewpider meet, they display their water bubbles to each other. Then the one with the smaller bubble gets out of the other’s way."
Araquanid,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/752/,"It acts as a caretaker for dewpider, putting them inside its bubble and letting them eat any leftover food. It usually passes its time in the water. When its belly is full, it stores its subdued prey in the water bubble on its head. It launches water bubbles with its legs, drowning prey within the bubbles. This pokémon can then take its time to savor its meal. It delivers headbutts with the water bubble on its head. Small pokémon get sucked into the bubble, where they drown. It has a habit of storing things it values in its water bubble. If its trainer doesn’t watch out, araquanid will try to put them in its bubble! Despite what its appearance suggests, it cares for others. If it finds vulnerable, weak pokémon, it protectively brings them into its water bubble."
Fomantis,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/753/,"During the day, fomantis basks in sunlight and sleeps peacefully. It wakes and moves around at night. They give off a sweet and refreshing scent. Cutiefly often gather near the tall grass where fomantis are hiding. When the sun rises, fomantis spreads its four leaves and bathes in the sunlight. The tip of its head has a pleasant aroma. During the day, it sleeps and soaks up light. When night falls, it walks around looking for a safer place to sleep. When bathed in sunlight, this pokémon emits a pleasantly sweet scent, which causes bug pokémon to gather around it. It loves the sunshine. When it basks in the sunlight regularly, it grows up with vivid coloration."
Lurantis,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/754/,"The petals on this pokémon’s arms are thin and super sharp, and they can fire laser beams if lurantis gathers light first. This pokémon resembles a beautiful flower. A properly raised lurantis will have gorgeous, brilliant colors. For self-protection, it pretends to be a bug pokémon. Both of its arms bear keen-edged petals. As it slashes into its enemies, it looks like it’s dancing. Its elegant appearance has led some to call it the most glamorous grass pokémon. It requires a lot of effort to maintain lurantis’s vivid coloring, but some collectors enjoy this work and treat it as their hobby. It fires beams from its sickle-shaped petals. These beams are powerful enough to cleave through thick metal plates."
Morelull,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/755/,"As it drowses the day away, it nourishes itself by sucking from tree roots. It wakens at the fall of night, wandering off in search of a new tree. Pokémon living in the forest eat the delicious caps on morelull’s head. The caps regrow overnight. It scatters spores that flicker and glow. Anyone seeing these lights falls into a deep slumber. It likes damp dark places. When night falls, the spores filling the caps of its mushrooms glow. Morelull live in forests that stay dark even during the day. They scatter flickering spores that put enemies to sleep. It scatters its shining spores around itself. Even though they’re dangerous, nighttime tours of forests where morelull live are popular."
Shiinotic,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/756/,"Its flickering spores lure in prey and put them to sleep. Once this pokémon has its prey snoozing, it drains their vitality with its fingertips. It puts its prey to sleep and siphons off their vitality through the tip of its arms. If one of its kind is weakened, it helps by sending it vitality. Forests where shiinotic live are treacherous to enter at night. People confused by its strange lights can never find their way home again. It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness. When its prey succumb to sleep, this pokémon feeds on them by sucking in their energy. If you see a light deep in a forest at night, don’t go near. Shiinotic will make you fall fast asleep. When it starts fighting for territory with parasect, the entire area gets completely coated in spores!"
Salandit,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/757/,"It weakens opponents and sends them reeling with its poisonous gas. Salandit doesn’t deal well with spinda, since it’s always reeling. Volcanoes or dry, craggy places are its home. It emanates a sweet-smelling poisonous gas that attracts bug pokémon, then attacks them. The males will do whatever the females tell them. They give the females most of their food. Due to malnutrition, the males can’t evolve. Its venom sacs produce a fluid that this pokémon then heats up with the flame in its tail. This process creates salandit’s poisonous gas. It burns its bodily fluids to create a poisonous gas. When its enemies become disoriented from inhaling the gas, it attacks them. This sneaky pokémon will slink behind its prey and immobilize it with poisonous gas before the prey even realizes salandit is there."
Salazzle,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/758/,"Filled with pheromones, its poisonous gas can be diluted to use in the production of luscious perfumes. Only female salazzle exist. They emit a gas laden with pheromones to captivate male salandit. It punishes salandit that couldn’t bring it food with a fierce slap of its flame-spewing palm. The winner of competitions between salazzle is decided by which one has the most male salandit with it. For some reason, only females have been found. It creates a reverse harem of male salandit that it lives with. Salazzle lives deep in caves and forces the salandit it has attracted with its pheromones to serve it."
Stufful,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/759/,"Its fluffy fur is a delight to pet, but carelessly reaching out to touch this pokémon could result in painful retaliation. Despite its adorable appearance, when it gets angry and flails about, its arms and legs could knock a pro wrestler sprawling. Stufful hates to be hugged or touched in any way. It will squirm, thrash, and resist with amazing power. The way it protects itself by flailing its arms may be an adorable sight, but stay well away. This is flailing that can snap thick tree trunks. A touch from anyone except a known friend sends it into a surging frenzy. It’s an incredibly dangerous pokémon. It boasts power enough to split large trees in half. The organ on its rear releases an odor that it uses to communicate with others of its kind."
Bewear,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/760/,"This pokémon has the habit of hugging its companions. Many trainers have left this world after their spines were squashed by its hug. Once it accepts you as a friend, it tries to show its affection with a hug. Letting it do that is dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones. It waves its hands wildly in intimidation and warning. Life is over for anyone who doesn’t run away as fast as possible. It boasts tremendous physical strength. Many people call it the most dangerous pokémon in the alola region. This immensely dangerous pokémon possesses overwhelming physical strength. Its habitat is generally off-limits. The moves it uses to take down its prey would make a martial artist jealous. It tucks subdued prey under its arms to carry them to its nest."
Bounsweet,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/761/,"Because of its sweet, delicious aroma, bird pokémon are always after it, but it’s not intelligent enough to care. When under attack, it secretes a sweet and delicious sweat. The scent only calls more enemies to it. Its body gives off a sweet, fruity scent that is extremely appetizing to bird pokémon. It tries to resist being swallowed by a bird pokémon by spinning the sepals on its head. It’s usually a fruitless attempt. A delectable aroma pours from its body. They are often swallowed whole by toucannon lured by that wafting deliciousness. Although it’s too sugary for human consumption, bounsweet’s sweat can be watered down into a juice with just the right amount of sweetness."
Steenee,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/762/,"It’s protected by its hard sepals, so it plays with bird pokémon without worry. They peck it relentlessly, but it doesn’t care. Any corvisquire that pecks at this pokémon will be greeted with a smack from its sepals followed by a sharp kick. It bounces around, swinging the sepals on its head with abandon. They’re quite painful when they smack you! The sepals on its head developed to protect its body. These are quite hard, so even if pecked by bird pokémon, this pokémon is totally fine. As it twirls like a dancer, a sweet smell spreads out around it. Anyone who inhales the scent will feel a surge of happiness. This pokémon is always bouncing around energetically. Other pokémon are attracted by its lively appearance and pleasant aroma."
Tsareena,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/763/,"A pokémon with an aggressive personality and a mastery of kicking, it cackles every time it kicks an opponent. Its long, striking legs aren’t just for show but to be used to kick with skill. In victory, it shows off by kicking the defeated, laughing boisterously. A kick from the hardened tips of this pokémon’s legs leaves a wound in the opponent’s body and soul that will never heal. This feared pokémon has long, slender legs and a cruel heart. It shows no mercy as it stomps on its opponents. A master of grand and beautiful kicks, it can knock out even kickboxing champions with a single blow. A pokémon known for the beauty of its well-shaped legs, it sometimes appears as a mascot in advertisements for beauty salons."
Comfey,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/764/,"It stretches sticky vines out from its head and picks flowers to adorn itself with. When it doesn’t have any flowers, it feels uneasy. It attaches flowers to its highly nutritious vine. This revitalizes the flowers, and they give off an aromatic scent. Comfey picks flowers with its vine and decorates itself with them. For some reason, flowers won’t wither once they’re attached to a comfey. It picks flowers and sticks them to its body with fluids it produces. The aroma that wafts from its petals has a healing effect. Baths prepared with the flowers from its vine have a relaxing effect, so this pokémon is a hit with many people. These pokémon smell very nice. All comfey wear different flowers, so each of these pokémon has its own individual scent."
Oranguru,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/765/,"Known for its extreme intelligence, this pokémon will look down on inexperienced trainers, so it’s best suited to veteran trainers. It knows the forest inside and out. If it comes across a wounded pokémon, oranguru will gather medicinal herbs to treat it. Oranguru don’t get along with each other, so they’re always engaging in battles of wits to decide which one is superior. It normally spends its time meditating in the treetops. It throws poké balls and gives other pokémon orders as it pleases. Deep in the jungle, high in the lofty canopy, this pokémon abides. On rare occasions, it shows up at the beach to match wits with slowking. With waves of its fan—made from leaves and its own fur—oranguru skillfully gives instructions to other pokémon."
Passimian,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/766/,"They battle with hard berries for weapons. Their techniques are passed from the boss to the group, generation upon generation. Berries are its weapons as well as the staple of its diet. The one that can throw a berry the farthest is the boss of the troop. Passimian live in groups of about 20, with each member performing an assigned role. Through cooperation, the group survives. They form groups of roughly 20 individuals. Their mutual bond is remarkable—they will never let down a comrade. Displaying amazing teamwork, they follow the orders of their boss as they all help out in the search for their favorite berries. They use their saliva to stick leaves to their shoulders. You can tell what troop they belong to from the position of the leaves."
Wimpod,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/767/,"Wimpod gather in swarms, constantly on the lookout for danger. They scatter the moment they detect an enemy’s presence. It’s nature’s cleaner—it eats anything and everything, including garbage and rotten things. The ground near its nest is always clean. This pokémon is a coward. As it desperately dashes off, the flailing of its many legs leaves a sparkling clean path in its wake. It will pick up anything it finds on the ground. Sometimes it finds coins, so murkrow and meowth will go after it. Its habitat varies from beaches to seabeds. A natural scavenger, it will gleefully chow down on anything edible, no matter how rotten. An astonishingly cowardly pokémon, wimpod will whir its legs at high speeds to run away if anything comes near it."
Golisopod,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/768/,"The shell covering its body is as hard as diamond. This pokémon will do anything it takes to win. With a flashing slash of its giant sharp claws, it cleaves seawater—or even air—right in two. It will do anything to win, taking advantage of every opening and finishing opponents off with the small claws on its front legs. They live in sunken ships or in holes in the seabed. When golisopod and grapploct battle, the loser becomes the winner’s meal. Its claws, which it can extend and retract at will, are its greatest weapons. Golisopod is sometimes accompanied by wimpod. It battles skillfully with its six arms, but spends most of its time peacefully meditating in caves deep beneath the sea."
Sandygast,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/769/,"Born from a sand mound playfully built by a child, this pokémon embodies the grudges of the departed. It likes the shovel on its head, so sandygast will get serious and fight any children who come to take it back. It takes control of anyone who puts a hand in its mouth. And so it adds to the accumulation of its sand-mound body. If you build sand mounds when you’re playing, destroy them before you go home, or they may get possessed and become sandygast. Grudges of the dead have possessed a mound of sand and become a pokémon. Sandygast is fond of the shovel on its head. Sandygast mainly inhabits beaches. It takes control of anyone who puts their hand into its mouth, forcing them to make its body bigger."
Palossand,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/770/,"Each of its grains of sand has its own will. Palossand eats small pokémon and siphons away their vital essence while they’re still alive. Once it has whipped up a sandstorm to halt its opponents in their tracks, this terrifying pokémon snatches away their vitality. This pokémon lives on beaches, but it hates water. Palossand can’t maintain its castle-like shape if it gets drenched by a heavy rain. Palossand is known as the beach nightmare. It pulls its prey down into the sand by controlling the sand itself, and then it sucks out their souls. Buried beneath the castle are masses of dried-up bones from those whose vitality it has drained. Possessed people controlled by this pokémon transformed its sand mound into a castle. As it evolved, its power to curse grew ever stronger."
Pyukumuku,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/771/,"The tradition known as pyukumuku chucking started from the custom of throwing pyukumuku back into the sea after they wash onshore. It’s covered in a slime that keeps its skin moist, allowing it to stay on land for days without drying up. It lives in shallow seas, such as areas near a beach. It can eject its internal organs, which it uses to engulf its prey or battle enemies. It lives in warm, shallow waters. If it encounters a foe, it will spit out its internal organs as a means to punch them. Its entire body is covered in its own slime. If you accidentally step on one, you’ll slip, and it will get mad and smack you! These pokémon line the beaches. The sticky mucous that covers their bodies can be used to soothe sunburned skin. How convenient!"
Type-null,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/772/,"The heavy control mask it wears suppresses its intrinsic capabilities. This pokémon has some hidden special power. It was modeled after a mighty pokémon of myth. The mask placed upon it limits its power in order to keep it under control. Rumor has it that the theft of top-secret research notes led to a new instance of this pokémon being created in the galar region. There’s danger of its going on a rampage, so its true power is sealed away beneath its control mask. Due to the danger that this synthetic pokémon may go on a rampage, it wears a control mask to restrain its power. A pokémon weapon developed for a specific mission, it went berserk during an experiment, so it was cryogenically frozen."
Silvally,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/773/,"The final factor needed to release this pokémon’s true power was a strong bond with a trainer it trusts. A solid bond of trust between this pokémon and its trainer awakened the strength hidden within silvally. It can change its type at will. Although its name was type: null at first, the boy who evolved it into this form gave it the name by which it is now known. Its trust in its partner is what awakens it. This pokémon is capable of changing its type, a flexibility that is well displayed in battle. This is its form once it has awakened and evolved. Freed from its heavy mask, its speed is greatly increased. Through the bond it formed with its trainer, its will was strengthened, and it was able to destroy its control mask."
Minior,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/774/,"Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable, the shock of falling to the ground smashes the shell to smithereens. Originally making its home in the ozone layer, it hurtles to the ground when the shell enclosing its body grows too heavy. It lives in the ozone layer, where it becomes food for stronger pokémon. When it tries to run away, it falls to the ground. Strong impacts can knock it out of its shell. This pokémon was born from mutated nanoparticles."
Komala,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/775/,"The log it holds was given to it by its parents at birth. It has also been known to cling to the arm of a friendly trainer. It remains asleep from birth to death as a result of the sedative properties of the leaves that form its diet. It is born asleep, and it dies asleep. All its movements are apparently no more than the results of it tossing and turning in its dreams. It stays asleep from the moment it’s born. When it falls into a deep sleep, it stops moving altogether."
Turtonator,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/776/,"It lives in volcanoes and eats sulfur and other minerals. Materials from the food it eats form the basis of its explosive shell. Its exploding shell poses a real danger but is sensitive to moisture. On rainy days, turtonator takes silent refuge in caves. Eating sulfur in its volcanic habitat is what causes explosive compounds to develop in its shell. Its droppings are also dangerously explosive. It gushes fire and poisonous gases from its nostrils. Its dung is an explosive substance and can be put to various uses. Explosive substances coat the shell on its back. Enemies that dare attack it will be blown away by an immense detonation. The shell on its back is chemically unstable and explodes violently if struck. The hole in its stomach is its weak point."
Togedemaru,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/777/,"The long hairs on its back act as lightning rods. The bolts of lightning it attracts are stored as energy in its electric sac. With the long hairs on its back, this pokémon takes in electricity from other electric pokémon. It stores what it absorbs in an electric sac. When it’s surprised or agitated, the 14 fur spikes on its back will stand up involuntarily. The spiny fur on its back is normally at rest. When this pokémon becomes agitated, its fur stands on end and stabs into its attackers. When it’s in trouble, it curls up into a ball, makes its fur spikes stand on end, and then discharges electricity indiscriminately. Its capacity to produce electricity is somewhat limited, so it gets charged up by letting lightning strike it!"
Mimikyu,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/778/,"It wears a rag fashioned into a pikachu costume in an effort to look less scary. Unfortunately, the costume only makes it creepier. A lonely pokémon, it conceals its terrifying appearance beneath an old rag so it can get closer to people and other pokémon. Its actual appearance is unknown. A scholar who saw what was under its rag was overwhelmed by terror and died from the shock. There was a scientist who peeked under mimikyu’s old rag in the name of research. The scientist died of a mysterious disease. Although it’s a quiet, lonely pokémon, if you try to look at what’s under its rag, it will become agitated and resist violently. A gust of wind revealed what hides under this pokémon’s rag to a passing trainer, who went home and died painfully that very night."
Bruxish,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/779/,"It burrows beneath the sand, radiating psychic power from the protuberance on its head. It waits for prey as it surveys the area. It stuns its prey with psychokinesis and then grinds them to mush with its strong teeth. Even shellder’s shell is no match for it. Its skin is thick enough to fend off mareanie’s spikes. With its robust teeth, bruxish crunches up the spikes and eats them. When it unleashes its psychic power from the protuberance on its head, the grating sound of grinding teeth echoes through the area."
Drampa,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/780/,"Drampa is a kind and friendly pokémon—up until it’s angered. When that happens, it stirs up a gale and flattens everything around. It has a compassionate personality, but if it is angered, it completely destroys its surroundings with its intense breath. If a child it has made friends with is bullied, drampa will find the bully’s house and burn it to the ground. The mountains it calls home are nearly two miles in height. On rare occasions, it descends to play with the children living in the towns below. This pokémon is friendly to people and loves children most of all. It comes from deep in the mountains to play with children it likes in town. It appears in towns and plays with the children. Drampa will protect kids when they’re in danger, so their moms don’t have to worry."
Dhelmise,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/781/,"Swinging its massive anchor, it can ko wailord in a single blow. What appears to be green seaweed is actually its body. Its chain-like green seaweed can stretch outward for hundreds of yards. For some reason, it gets along well with skrelp. It wraps its prey in green seaweed and sucks away their vitality. It only likes to go after big prey like wailord. The soul of seaweed adrift in the waves became reborn as this pokémon. It maintains itself with new infusions of seabed detritus and seaweed. After lowering its anchor, it waits for its prey. It catches large wailord and drains their life-force. After a piece of seaweed merged with debris from a sunken ship, it was reborn as this ghost pokémon."
Jangmo-o,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/782/,"It expresses its feelings by smacking its scales. Metallic sounds echo through the tall mountains where jangmo-o lives. They learn to fight by smashing their head scales together. The dueling strengthens both their skills and their spirits. It will never show an enemy its back in battle. Ancient warriors liked jangmo-o for its valiant disposition and made it one of their own. Jangmo-o strikes its scales to communicate with others of its kind. Its scales are actually fur that’s become as hard as metal. It smacks the scales on its head against rocks or against the ground to frighten its opponents. It can also contact its friends with these noises. They live in mountains where no trace of humans can be detected. Jangmo-o grow little by little as they battle one another."
Hakamo-o,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/783/,"It sheds and regrows its scales on a continuous basis. The scales become harder and sharper each time they’re regrown. It makes noise by clanging its scales together. When the rhythm has reached its peak, hakamo-o attacks. Before attacking its enemies, it clashes its scales together and roars. Its sharp claws shred the opposition. The scaleless, scarred parts of its body are signs of its strength. It shows them off to defeated opponents. The scales it sheds can be molded and processed to make pots and pans. They conduct heat well, so they’re a popular item. It leaps at its prey with a courageous shout. Its scaly punches tear its opponents to shreds."
Kommo-o,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/784/,"It battles valiantly with its fists, which are armored in steel scales. Kommo-o specializes in uppercuts. When it spots enemies, it threatens them by jingling the scales on its tail. Weak opponents will crack and flee in panic. It clatters its tail scales to unnerve opponents. This pokémon will battle only those who stand steadfast in the face of this display. Certain ruins have paintings of ancient warriors wearing armor made of kommo-o scales. When it howls after finishing off its prey, the metallic sounds of its celebrating comrades can be heard from all around. Its rigid scales function as offense and defense.

Tapu-fini,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/788/,"The dense fog it creates brings the downfall and destruction of its confused enemies. Ocean currents are the source of its energy. The guardian deity of poni, it can control water. People say it can create pure water that will wash away any uncleanness. This guardian deity of poni island manipulates water.

Cosmog,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/789/,"Cosmog is very curious but not very cautious, often placing itself in danger. If things start to look dicey, it teleports away. Even though its helpless, gaseous body can be blown away by the slightest breeze, it doesn’t seem to care. Whether or not it’s a pokémon from this world is a mystery. When it’s in a jam, it warps away to a safe place to hide. Its body is gaseous and frail. It slowly grows as it collects dust from the atmosphere. This pokémon came from another universe.

It sucks in dust from the air at an astounding rate, frantically building up energy within its core as preparation for evolution. Motionless as if dead, its body is faintly warm to the touch. In the distant past, it was called the cocoon of the stars. As it absorbs light, cosmoem continues to grow. Its golden shell is surprisingly solid. The king who ruled alola in times of antiquity called it the “cocoon of the stars” and built an altar to worship it. The absorption of starlight fuels this pokémon’s growth. The shell that encases it is harder than any known material."
Solgaleo,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/791/,"Solgaleo was once known as the beast that devours the sun. Energy in the form of light radiates boundlessly from it.

It needs light to survive, and it goes on a rampage seeking it out. Its laser beams will cut anything to pieces. Reminiscent of the ultra beasts, this life-form, apparently asleep underground, is thought to have come from another world in ancient times. Light is the source of its energy.

It’s apparently from another world."

Poipole,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/803/,"This ultra beast is well enough liked to be chosen as a first partner in its own world. An ultra beast that lives in a different world, it cackles wildly as it sprays its opponents with poison from the needles on its head."

Meltan,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/808/,"They live as a group, but when the time comes, one strong meltan will absorb all the others and evolve. It dissolves and eats metal.

Melmetal,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/809/,"Centrifugal force is behind the punches of melmetal’s heavy hex-nut arms. Melmetal is said to deliver the strongest punches of all pokémon.

Thwackey,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/811/,"When it’s drumming out rapid beats in battle, it gets so caught up in the rhythm that it won’t even notice that it’s already knocked out its opponent.

Skwovet,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/819/,"Found throughout the galar region, this pokémon becomes uneasy if its cheeks are ever completely empty of berries.

Greedent,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/820/,"It stashes berries in its tail—so many berries that they fall out constantly.

Dubwool,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/832/,"Weave a carpet from its springy wool, and you end up with something closer to a trampoline. You’ll start to bounce the moment you set foot on it. Its majestic horns are meant only to impress the opposite gender. They never see use in battle."
Chewtle,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/833/,"Apparently the itch of its teething impels it to snap its jaws at anything in front of it. It starts off battles by attacking with its rock-hard horn, but as soon as the opponent flinches, this pokémon bites down and never lets go."

Applin,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/840/,"As soon as it’s born, it burrows into an apple.

Sandaconda,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/844/,"When it contracts its body, over 220 pounds of sand sprays from its nose. If it ever runs out of sand, it becomes disheartened. Its unique style of coiling allows it to blast sand out of its sand sac more efficiently."
Cramorant,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/845/,"It’s so strong that it can knock out some opponents in a single hit, but it also may forget what it’s battling midfight.

Arrokuda,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/846/,"If it sees any movement around it, this pokémon charges for it straightaway, leading with its sharply pointed jaw.

Grapploct,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/853/,"Searching for an opponent to test its skills against, it emerges onto land. Once the battle is over, it returns to the sea.

Polteageist,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/855/,"This species lives in antique teapots. Most pots are forgeries, but on rare occasions, an authentic work is found.

Hatenna,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/856/,"Via the protrusion on its head, it senses other creatures’ emotions. If you don’t have a calm disposition, it will never warm up to you.

Hattrem,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/857/,"No matter who you are, if you bring strong emotions near this pokémon, it will silence you violently. Using the braids on its head, it pummels foes to get them to quiet down. One blow from those braids would knock out a professional boxer."

Cursola,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/864/,"Be cautious of the ectoplasmic body surrounding its soul. You’ll become stiff as stone if you touch it. Its shell is overflowing with its heightened otherworldly energy. The ectoplasm serves as protection for this pokémon’s core spirit."
Sirfetchd,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/865/,"After deflecting attacks with its hard leaf shield, it strikes back with its sharp leek stalk. The leek stalk is both weapon and food.

Runerigus,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/867/,"Never touch its shadowlike body, or you’ll be shown the horrific memories behind the picture carved into it. A powerful curse was woven into an ancient painting. After absorbing the spirit of a yamask, the painting began to move."

Falinks,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/870/,"Five of them are troopers, and one is the brass. The brass’s orders are absolute. The six of them work together as one pokémon. Teamwork is also their battle strategy, and they constantly change their formation as they fight."
Pincurchin,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/871/,"It feeds on seaweed, using its teeth to scrape it off rocks. Electric current flows from the tips of its spines.

Snom,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/872/,"It spits out thread imbued with a frigid sort of energy and uses it to tie its body to branches, disguising itself as an icicle while it sleeps. It eats snow that piles up on the ground. The more snow it eats, the bigger and more impressive the spikes on its back grow."
Frosmoth,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/873/,"Icy scales fall from its wings like snow as it flies over fields and mountains. The temperature of its wings is less than −290 degrees fahrenheit. It shows no mercy to any who desecrate fields and mountains. It will fly around on its icy wings, causing a blizzard to chase offenders away."

Eiscue,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/875/,"This pokémon keeps its heat-sensitive head cool with ice. It fishes for its food, dangling its single hair into the sea to lure in prey. It drifted in on the flow of ocean waters from a frigid place. It keeps its head iced constantly to make sure it stays nice and cold."
Indeedee,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/876/,"It uses the horns on its head to sense the emotions of others. Males will act as valets for those they serve, looking after their every need.

Morpeko,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/877/,"As it eats the seeds stored up in its pocket-like pouches, this pokémon is not just satisfying its constant hunger.

Copperajah,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/879/,"They came over from another region long ago and worked together with humans. Their green skin is resistant to water. These pokémon live in herds. Their trunks have incredible grip strength, strong enough to crush giant rocks into powder."
Dracozolt,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/880/,"The powerful muscles in its tail generate its electricity. Compared to its lower body, its upper half is entirely too small. In ancient times, it was unbeatable thanks to its powerful lower body, but it went extinct anyway after it depleted all its plant-based food sources."
Arctozolt,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/881/,"The shaking of its freezing upper half is what generates its electricity. It has a hard time walking around. This pokémon lived on prehistoric seashores and was able to preserve food with the ice on its body. It went extinct because it moved so slowly."
Dracovish,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/882/,"Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator of its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was what drove it to extinction. Its mighty legs are capable of running at speeds exceeding 40 mph, but this pokémon can’t breathe unless it’s underwater."
Arctovish,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/883/,"Though it’s able to capture prey by freezing its surroundings, it has trouble eating the prey afterward because its mouth is on top of its head. The skin on its face is impervious to attack, but breathing difficulties made this pokémon go extinct anyway."
Duraludon,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/884/,"Its body resembles polished metal, and it’s both lightweight and strong. The only drawback is that it rusts easily. The special metal that composes its body is very light, so this pokémon has considerable agility. It lives in caves because it dislikes the rain."
Dreepy,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/885/,"If this weak pokémon is by itself, a mere child could defeat it. But if dreepy has friends to help it train, it can evolve and become much stronger. After being reborn as a ghost pokémon, dreepy wanders the areas it used to inhabit back when it was alive in prehistoric seas."
Drakloak,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/886/,"Without a dreepy to place on its head and care for, it gets so uneasy it’ll try to substitute any pokémon it finds for the missing dreepy. It’s capable of flying faster than 120 mph. It battles alongside dreepy and dotes on them until they successfully evolve."
Dragapult,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/887/,"Apparently the dreepy inside dragapult’s horns eagerly look forward to being launched out at mach speeds.

Zacian,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/888/,"This pokémon has slumbered for many years. Some say it’s zamazenta’s elder sister—others say the two pokémon are rivals. Known as a legendary hero, this pokémon absorbs metal particles, transforming them into a weapon it uses to battle."
Zamazenta,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/889/,"This pokémon slept for aeons while in the form of a statue. It was asleep for so long, people forgot that it ever existed.

Kubfu,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/891/,"If kubfu pulls the long white hair on its head, its fighting spirit heightens and power wells up from the depths of its belly. Kubfu trains hard to perfect its moves. The moves it masters will determine which form it takes when it evolves."
Urshifu,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/892/,"This form of urshifu is a strong believer in the one-hit ko. Its strategy is to leap in close to foes and land a devastating blow with a hardened fist.

Zarude,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/893/,"Within dense forests, this pokémon lives in a pack with others of its kind.

Regidrago,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/895/,"Its body is composed of crystallized dragon energy. Regidrago is said to have the powers of every dragon pokémon. An academic theory proposes that regidrago’s arms were once the head of an ancient dragon pokémon. The theory remains unproven."
Glastrier,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/896/,"Glastrier emits intense cold from its hooves. It’s also a belligerent pokémon—anything it wants, it takes by force. Glastrier has tremendous physical strength, and the mask of ice covering its face is 100 times harder than diamond."
Spectrier,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/897/,"It probes its surroundings with all its senses save one—it doesn’t use its sense of sight.

Floragato,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/907/,"Floragato deftly wields the vine hidden beneath its long fur, slamming the hard flower bud against its opponents.

Meowscarada,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/908/,"This pokémon uses the reflective fur lining its cape to camouflage the stem of its flower, creating the illusion that the flower is floating. With skillful misdirection, it rigs foes with pollen-packed flower bombs. Meowscarada sets off the bombs before its foes realize what’s going on."
Fuecoco,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/909/,"It lies on warm rocks and uses the heat absorbed by its square-shaped scales to create fire energy. Its flame sac is small, so energy is always leaking out. This energy is released from the dent atop fuecoco’s head and flickers to and fro."
Crocalor,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/910/,"The combination of crocalor’s fire energy and overflowing vitality has caused an egg-shaped fireball to appear on the pokémon’s head.

It neutralizes its enemies in short order."
Pawmi,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/921/,"It has underdeveloped electric sacs on its cheeks.

Maschiff,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/942/,"Its well-developed jaw and fangs are strong enough to crunch through boulders, and its thick fat makes for an excellent defense.

Shroodle,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/944/,"Though usually a mellow pokémon, it will sink its sharp, poison-soaked front teeth into any that anger it, causing paralysis in the object of its ire.

Grafaiai,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/945/,"Each grafaiai paints its own individual pattern, and it will paint that same pattern over and over again throughout its life.

Capsakid,https://pokeapi.Co/api/v2/pokemon-species/951/,"Traditional paldean dishes can be extremely spicy because they include the shed front teeth of capsakid among their ingredients.
